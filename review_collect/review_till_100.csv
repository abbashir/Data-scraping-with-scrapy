Small design changes wish Lenovo would address in future versions. I thik I keep hitting the ctrl key in the lower left but am hitting the function key. they should switch places. Also the function key has an indicator light ... why? it never goes off. It would make more sense for the capslock key to have an indicator light. I can never tell when I'm typing passwords if I accidentally hit caps lock or not because there is no notice whether it is activated or not. And last thing is understanding some new gestures. Both when I use the touchscreen and the touchpad, sometimes when I'm swiping left right to scroll the screen over, it actually switched apps, then I can't get the window/app back that I wanted."

Emmc needs to be read as an USB SD card reader to act as a boot device! M.2 slot is avalible but the motherboard manufacturer placed the M.2 slots near the center of the board inline with mounting holes so a full size M.2 drive will not fit!

B06Y436KYR,1,Most comfortable headset - UNTIL IT BREAKS,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HQBF55T2W828/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06Y436KYR," December 27, 2018",Jesse,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE: Well I DID like this headset, until the volume control starting distorting my audio. No big deal, one year warranty, right? Absolutely wrong. HP's website to try and make a warranty claim is a nightmare, and their customer service is even worse. This product does not have a serial number ANYWHERE on it, but both online and through the phone the customer service representatives will not help you without one. I'm told that the serial number comes ON A STICKER. A damned sticker, supposedly on the bars on top of the headset. Besides the borderline criminal irresponsibility of putting a unique product identifier required for a legally-entitled warranty on a weak sticker, I am certain my product never came with such a sticker. Their customer service people have been unbelievably useless, it's an Indian call center that throws you around from person to person repeating the same ""I'm sorry sir but without your serial number we cannot help you"". Amazon Order information is useless to them, they don't care about your invoice, only the sticker that supposedly comes on a headset. To even get the phone number to call HP support I had to enter a dummy serial number just so it would let me click the ""get phone number"" button. It honestly feels like a scam to keep people from redeeming their warranty when their product inevitably breaks, serial number on a sticker. . . No way in hell am I ever buying something from HP again. Not a headset, not a computer, not a printer, not even ink and I'm going to do my damn best to make sure no one else does either; a warranty shouldn't be this difficult when a product breaks due to a manufacturer defect. I'm in awe of the way HP is handling this."
B06Y436KYR,5,Was reluctant...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OW24PKOZAKFA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06Y436KYR," December 4, 2018",Amazon Customer,Verified Purchase,"When I originally saw this product for a cheaper price, I was a bit reluctant. It was described as used, which at first was a bit ""eehh"" for me, but upon further inspection it just said box has been opened. I do not know why these are priced lower than the others, but it all came with original packaging and it was the real product. Smelled new. Box was in good condition, but I didn't really care about the packaging as long as the product was in good condition. The product works great. It picks up my voice well, and this is my first higher end headset that I have gotten and I heard sounds that I never before heard in games. It was so surprising to me, that I was distracted a lot in my game just listening to these additional sounds that I didn't know were there. Not only does it sound amazing for games, where it just really gets you into the whole atmosphere, it also sounds incredible if you use it to listen to music. The headset itself can get very loud, even if your TV volume is down and your mic sensitivity is low, you will have to adjust the sound settings in various games to stop from echoing. You can just continue to change it on your TV and your primary menu, but you will be adjusting it every time you switch games, so I just recommend just setting it up in individual games so that you don't have to keep messing around. One thing that is odd, is even when you are muted, you occasionally echo other people you are grouped up with, or sometimes your mic will echo a single sound that is in the game. This is a bit odd, but it is only occasionally. This may not be the case for every person who has this, it may just be an odd fluke with mine."
B06Y436KYR,5,Great fitting fully over the entire ear design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKQVWKQDZEK8L/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06Y436KYR," July 25, 2018",JW,Verified Purchase,"Great fitting fully over the entire ear design. My personal preference, as I hate having things on my ears for any extended period of time. Sound quality is top notch, great lows mids and highs. The mic feels a little cheap the way it pulls out, but after using it for the past few months, I have decided it's actually just really cool. It slides up into the left ear bonnet easily and works great when in use... You won't be disappointed with this headphone/mic setup."

When I played a game, I immediately noticed that it frequently would stop working and the lights would flash.

I've had many problems with USB wireless and blue-tooth mice skipping and hesitating on windows 10 1709. I decided to give this mouse a try. I love it. It is precise and very smooth in motion. It is easy to set dpi and acceleration to get just the right feel for me. The buttons have enough tactical feel so I know I have clicked and it responds instantly. It glides very smoothly on my mouse pad and does not skip. The mouse feels great in my large hands. I made 2 extra weights from 1/2"" brass rod turned down to .4695"" x .2390 to get a little more heft to the mouse. I don't think I could ask for a better mouse. I do recommend this to anyone looking for a well mannered rodent. The native windows drivers and mouse controls work perfectly with the mouse. To remove the bottom cover for the weights you use a small screwdriver to gently pry up the cover. Don't force it . The 3 supplied weights are already in the mouse when you get it."

Your average budget desktop computer you buy at Costco/Walmart/Best Buy are loaded with crap and don't even have a SSD. If you buy a computer nowadays you need to have a SSD, everything is so much more responsive with one. It's a night and day difference compared to the old hard drives with platters and moving parts.

If I were to compare the two, this one is noticeably more light weight. It's has a great design. Everything is smooth and thin. The sound quality is about the same honestly. The camera is much better, but do not expect quality like you would on a phone or an actual camera. The screen quality is definitely nice. I love how you can fold it and it looks like a tablet.

It does support 2 monitors well and to make things more complex, I have 2 laptops which means 2 docks.

I do have one more complaint but I don't know if it was Amazon or the Wavlink who is to blame.

I haven't upgraded the Ubuntu to 18.x just because in the past this has always been a problem point, you spend days recovering from Linux upgrades. The positives are 1) 64gb RAM I never run out of memory running Java server apps, 2) well behaved under stress there's no a lot of wild fan activity, 3) backlit keyboard is nice. Negatives are 1) clunky Lenovo design same old form factor from 15 years ago and very bulky, 2) display a little washed out if you're used to say a Mac retina. I mostly use it like a desktop with external monitor and keyboard and all of this works with no issues. Haven't had to go fishing around looking for Linux tweaks which is unusual.

I recommend going into your Nvidia control panel -> adjust desktop color settings and take the gamma down to .67 to address the brightness issue. I'm not sure where to go for that in AMD's control panel. Simply messing with the monitor's settings will not work for the brightness issue without making everything else look horrible.

This small business/home office server performed so well, I bought another 30 days later to convert into a workstation. I suggest adding a SSD 256GB Samsung 6 GB/sec drive for the file system/operating system files and I point out the buyers should be aware there is only a HDMI video plug and therefore should have a HDMI -> DVI cable handy if needed. The one knock I have on this Tower Server is its black inset Power Button is nearly invisible on its black case. In shaded areas, the user needs a flashlight to locate and use the Power Button. The manufacturer needs to chrome the exterior of the Power Switch to help make it obvious and discern it from the black case. The worse knock on this server is the top two hard drive cages are too close to the power supply to slide in hard drives much less hot swap them out. Is the only way to add hard drives to the top two of the four hard drive cages by first removing the entire power supply? That seems like a total lapse of design and engineering on this product.

However lately I've noticed they've become much more expensive and have this annoying tendency to have the scroll overly sensitive. I was in the market to shop for an inexpensive, basic wireless mouse and everything I saw of logitech were bulky and beyond a reasonable price. All I needed was a mouse for my work desktop that did the basic functions, didn't need back and forth buttons, or pulling up the start menu. Here is where I found the HP Z3700 mouse. I've been using it for a day now and I love it. Its light weight, basic, and does everything I need. Its also very slim and can fit in my pocket if I need to take my laptop around the office. Best part, if it breaks or gets misplaced, its only $12, compared to my other logitech mice of $40+. Win for simplicity. Can't speak about battery life or overall reliability.

It's not totally flat and has enough of a bump to mild into my palm and indeed my wife's hand which is somewhat smaller. If you like a bulging mouse...why the heck would you buy this and then complain about it as another reviewer did? Clearly states the shape in the pictures. I also love how this mouse works on any surface so far: bedspread , jeans, couch, carpet... anything so far. The scroll wheel is very responsive and can be used to open new browser tones and scroll down pages. All for under 20 bucks.

I needed a larger drive to store my games on. Out of the box, I formatted the drive to exFAT indicates about 1.86tb (1908GB) of usable space. I used the crystal disk mark to test performance and the numbers were comparable or better than my crucial drive. I proceeded to clone the crucial over to the micron. Once everything was cloned over I ran another test and the write performance started to underperform. I checked the drive format and it was now formatted as NTFS which was the format my crucial had. I ran tests on the crucial 512SSD and it had no issues, the read/write speeds were fine. I decided to format the micron as NTFS with nothing on the drive and ran the tests again, the write performance underperformed again. Formatted the micron a 3rd time to exFat and ran the test once more and the write performance was much better as exFAT format. Decided to copy over the data instead of attempting to clone. Tested the micron again and the numbers excelled once more. It seems like that this SSD doesn't perform well when formatted to NTFS. For the price per GB and overall it does perform well when formatted as exFat I am overall happy with the purchase and is a good bang for the buck."

You really can't beat the price, and the quality seems top notch. Write speeds are fast compared to many other budget SSDs. However, I wanted to point out that I tried exfat per a review here. However, it caused the drive to use far more space for my games. (Size on disk was about 25% larger than actual size). I ended up just cloning my 480GB SSD I was replacing, which was NTFS. I ran several tests with both file formats, and found them to be comparable. 4k 1QD reads test between 20-25MB/s, which while not mind blowing, is more than acceptable.

Turned on PC and got the blue Window recovery screen. I did not want to recover Windows. Installed new drivers for the card. This time it lasted 4 minutes before the black screen. Took out new card and put in the old. Got the recovery screen again. Did a restore of the system. Got my system up with no loses of any programs. I am very disappointed. I have a EVGA G850 PS.

It overclocks at the touch of a button in Gigabyte’s software, runs great, quiet, and keeps itself at a stable temp. The only reason I docked it a star is because my previous card, the Gigabyte GTX 1060 G1 Gaming card, was supposed to be the same reference design, so presumably the EKWB waterblock should fit it, but when Gigabyte designed the V2 1070, they changed the basic design from a reference model to a custom board, so no EKWB block will fit it, like it would for the V1 1070. Now I’m stuck with a $160 waterblock I can’t use, and had to buy ANOTHER $130 block from Bykski, who is currently the only maker of blocks for the version 2 1060’s and 1070’s.

Turns out, in terms of temps, the card maintains a comfortable temp of around 60-65 Celsius under full load. In terms of acoustics, I have not noticed any abnormal fan noice at any point during use, and the case is right next to me on the desk. I use a mid tower ATX case, with 5 fans ( 3 front intakes, 1 back exhaust, 1 top exhaust ) which might be helping it a bit to maintain temps. In terms of gaming performance it is a beast. 1080p gaming is a joke for this card, nothing I throw at it has proven too much for now. Checking out some benchmarks online, I can see that it is pretty competent for 1440p as well, most titles will play above 60fps on ultra. Overall, in my use scenario: 1080p high refresh rate/fps - it is an excellent purchase."

I upgraded the SSD in this one to 500GB and upgraded the memory to 16GB, and it runs lightening fast. Good price. I looked a newer models, and noted that cracking the case to upgrade is a pain. Wish Dell would keep that in mind, but I guess that's too much to hope for. This model came with Windows 10 Home and I upgraded to Windows Pro, as it allows you to turn off some annoying settings forced on you by Windows 10.

Let me start with the overall design. The cord itself is pretty durable and haven't had any ripping or tearing from having it dangle from a USB port most of the time. It has a volume dial on its cord to turn the volume up and down. So turn the sound on your PC all the way up like you would and use this thing to be more helpful. On this dial there is a couple of buttons: One to turn the ""vibration"" from the Bass off, and one to turn the microphone off. The headphones themselves have what I can only describe, at the moment of this writing, a ""cup"" design that covers the entire ear. This can sometimes irritate the sides of your ears and could be due to the ""vibration"" from the Bass mimicking, what I can describe as, having subwoofer style bass from a car. This is quite nice but some might not like it so the aforementioned button on the volume dial can turn this off. While on the topic of the speakers, the sides of these speakers emit light in the form of the logo for MSI that comes out in a bright red color--which compliment my laptops color as well. The headphones have a stretch design that will fit any size and can even wrap around your head while wearing a hat, snapback, etc. (So, for the streamers.) That's all for the headphones themselves but included with them is software to make them really standout because without it the PC will treat them as regular headphones and the sound will be terrible. If you have a laptop with no CD drive like me, you can hop onto their website and download the utility program from there, comes with the driver. One last thing to mention is the microphone. It's pretty good and does a good job of only capturing your voice with other sounds in the room (like a fan in the summer). Definitely, really good for a headset mmicrophone and my friends online can hear me beautifully but I still wouldn't compare it to any real high quality microphone. In short, the headset is well made and I would recommend it to anyone looking for better than average headphones."

When opening the laptop, the left hinge began popping out of place causing the plastic around the monitor to also come loose to the point that glass screen is now separated from the monitor and now the laptop can't even be opened without fear of breaking the screen. The laptop was never dropped or handled inappropriately in any way. Once the hinge began creaking and popping every time I opened it the problem became worse. After searching Lenovo repair message forums, it became clear the broken hinge problem is a manufacturer's defect that is known to affect the Y50 touch model. I called both the Lenovo support line and a local computer repair center to see what my options for repair were and both were familiar with the problem I had with this computer. To repair, the entire monitor needs to be replaced either by returning to Lenovo or an authorized repair center, with no guarantee it won't happen again. Worse, Lenovo would not guarantee that the problem was under warranty or that I wouldn't be charged for the repair.

I have had this happen before and changed the power settings so it doesn't happen anymore. The battery is reported to last 10 hours. I have only gotten about 6 hours, but I don't let the screen go dim. I like it brighter. Either way, 6 hours is significantly better than my previous laptop. I really like the touchscreen. The motion sensor and hand gesturing is a neat novelty but not very practical. I like having a solid state drive so that the computer boots up from 'sleep' instantly. That is probably my favorite feature. The screen is very attractive, although I have read reviews that it is not as good as it could have been. It does not have a DVD drive which for me is not a big deal but for some people it might be. The computer does not get warm at all. It stays very cool. There is a lot of useless bloatware that was easy to remove. I would have preferred a TB harddrive, but with the TB cloud storage from Microsoft, who needs a harddrive."
B00MHGDIH2,1,BUY ANOTHER BRAND,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBUNK6KV4GNK1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHGDIH2," July 21, 2015",jhh,,"DO NOT BUY! Idea Pad U530 touch 2 stars. The reason I give it a 2 is because it is a decent machine. But the hinges are CRAP. It is all over the internet. I am 17 days out of warranty and as so many other people my left hinge broke. I am lucky. I was able to catch it and my screen did not split. CUSTOMER NO SERVICE will let me pay a non refundable DIAGNOSIS fee. I have owned several lap tops, They have all lasted many years and the hard drive always broke. Never he case. So for a $1000. dollar year old computer. I am supposed to spend around 25% of original price. I will never buy another Lenovo and you should not either. BUY ANOTHER BRAND"
