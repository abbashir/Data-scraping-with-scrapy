Small design changes wish Lenovo would address in future versions. I thik I keep hitting the ctrl key in the lower left but am hitting the function key. they should switch places. Also the function key has an indicator light ... why? it never goes off. It would make more sense for the capslock key to have an indicator light. I can never tell when I'm typing passwords if I accidentally hit caps lock or not because there is no notice whether it is activated or not. And last thing is understanding some new gestures. Both when I use the touchscreen and the touchpad, sometimes when I'm swiping left right to scroll the screen over, it actually switched apps, then I can't get the window/app back that I wanted."

This particular model is a nice build, with removable battery, and easy access to hard drive and memory for upgrading to higher GB SSD, and more memory.. Backlight keyboard is nice feature, I would not get a computer without backlight keyboard. It is a thin, lightweight computer case, and if this same exact model came in a 17 inch, I would buy it in a second. I upgraded the SSD in this one to 500GB and upgraded the memory to 16GB, and it runs lightening fast. Good price. I looked a newer models, and noted that cracking the case to upgrade is a pain. Wish Dell would keep that in mind, but I guess that's too much to hope for. This model came with Windows 10 Home and I upgraded to Windows Pro, as it allows you to turn off some annoying settings forced on you by Windows 10. They have a long way to go on that operating system, believe me. But I recommend the computer, itself."

Let me start with the overall design. The cord itself is pretty durable and haven't had any ripping or tearing from having it dangle from a USB port most of the time. It has a volume dial on its cord to turn the volume up and down. So turn the sound on your PC all the way up like you would and use this thing to be more helpful. On this dial there is a couple of buttons: One to turn the ""vibration"" from the Bass off, and one to turn the microphone off. The headphones themselves have what I can only describe, at the moment of this writing, a ""cup"" design that covers the entire ear. This can sometimes irritate the sides of your ears and could be due to the ""vibration"" from the Bass mimicking, what I can describe as, having subwoofer style bass from a car. This is quite nice but some might not like it so the aforementioned button on the volume dial can turn this off. While on the topic of the speakers, the sides of these speakers emit light in the form of the logo for MSI that comes out in a bright red color--which compliment my laptops color as well. The headphones have a stretch design that will fit any size and can even wrap around your head while wearing a hat, snapback, etc. (So, for the streamers.) That's all for the headphones themselves but included with them is software to make them really standout because without it the PC will treat them as regular headphones and the sound will be terrible. If you have a laptop with no CD drive like me, you can hop onto their website and download the utility program from there, comes with the driver. One last thing to mention is the microphone. It's pretty good and does a good job of only capturing your voice with other sounds in the room (like a fan in the summer). Definitely, really good for a headset mmicrophone and my friends online can hear me beautifully but I still wouldn't compare it to any real high quality microphone. In short, the headset is well made and I would recommend it to anyone looking for better than average headphones."

When opening the laptop, the left hinge began popping out of place causing the plastic around the monitor to also come loose to the point that glass screen is now separated from the monitor and now the laptop can't even be opened without fear of breaking the screen. The laptop was never dropped or handled inappropriately in any way. Once the hinge began creaking and popping every time I opened it the problem became worse. After searching Lenovo repair message forums, it became clear the broken hinge problem is a manufacturer's defect that is known to affect the Y50 touch model. I called both the Lenovo support line and a local computer repair center to see what my options for repair were and both were familiar with the problem I had with this computer. To repair, the entire monitor needs to be replaced either by returning to Lenovo or an authorized repair center, with no guarantee it won't happen again. Worse, Lenovo would not guarantee that the problem was under warranty or that I wouldn't be charged for the repair. Beyond disappointed, spent $1200 for this laptop that is not as well made as a $200 chromebook. Beware of buying. I've returned this item to Amazon for a refund and will never buy Lenovo again."

I have only had it for a few days and it is running smoothly. All the games I have played on it I can run at the highest graphic settings with no loss of FPS. The 240Hz screen is amazing but I can really only notice the difference when using a web browser and not when gaming. Maybe people who have used these types of screens before could easily pick up the differences when gaming but a average consumer probably would not. The computer boots up fast as well as opens and closes programs fast, unlike my previous laptop. To top it off the computer has a really good cooling system as when playing Marvel Avengers on very high graphic settings the temperature stays somewhere between the high 70s to low 80s. All in all if you want to save some money but still get a high end gaming laptop then this is the choice for you."

I wont write pages upon pages here you can look up the issues. All I can say is I have spent 20+ hours trying to fix this and I cannot. Windows updater keeps updating and auto installing this software which trashes your internet connection and even when I follow Killers official instruction on their website it doesn't stop it. Microsoft has an option in windows to disable auto updating drivers and apps and its still happening. The weirdest part is it does not show up in programs to uninstall, but when I search for it the program is there and I can go to it. But I cannot uninstall it even with the killer official uninstaller. Ive blown so much time on this issue I am frustrated beyond belief and I believe the end result is that I will have to return this computer and make sure the next one I buy has no killer components. Its just so shady beyond belief. An auto installed program you can't stop or uninstall that does not detect as a program with anything not even third party uninstallers."

Had just used it for a few days when a bios issue came up and the computer failed to start. I contacted MSI and they told me to send it to an authorised service centre in Dubai (Jumbo electronics). Jumbo assured me that they would repair the laptop, but just needed confirmation of the warranty from MSI. However, MSI responded that I needed to have visited the states and needed me to show the flight ticket as proof. I had brought this laptop paying all the import duties and shipping taxes of about 200 dollars. This is the first time I‚Äôve heard that an international warranty needs a proof of visitation to be valid. Am I in the wrong here, or did MSI just cheat me of an extra 230 bucks?

Fresh out the box, it's sleek. Light weight and slim but has a nice sized screen. Upon turning it on, there's a computer voice walking you through setup (wireless, windows setup). NOTE: This computer DOES NOT come with Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc). I decline McAfee antivirus... I personally think that software jacks up your computer on purpose in order to get you to upgrade their software. That's just me. Anyway, so far so good. This laptop is nice! It only had Microsoft edge so I downloaded Chrome as my internet browser. It took one second and I was browsing the net. It's super fast. I can't speak to the battery life because I just started using it but I'm incredibly happy with this buy. If anything changes I'll edit this comment but so far so good."

I recently helped a family member buy a education series HP laptop (meant for schools) and it was very sturdy.

The trackpad was noted as being too sensetive, often being activated by the users palm while typing, and the unit has no webcam.

B0863DFMV7,1,"Really Poor Display Panel Choice by Asus, and 20% Re-stocking Fee",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15ZKKFH0KT6QW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0863DFMV7," July 3, 2020",PJ,Verified Purchase,"I hope this review helps someone in their decision-making. I loved everything I could know about this laptop from the Amazon listing and the ASUS website. Here's what I wish I knew: The display on this laptop is HORRIBLE for showing the spectrum of colors in the color spaces. Now, I know this is primarily a gaming laptop, but with the CPU and the Video Card, this machine processes data for photo and video editing very well - EXCEPT, you can't really tell what color the final product will be. I've attached pictures to show why. I didn't know any of this before I bought the laptop, I just am finally buying my first new laptop since 2005, and had one ""hand me down"" in between, so I was really excited to do some photo editing especially on this machine. Sadly, the choice that ASUS made of a display panel is horrible when it comes to colors - so if you need any depth or accuracy of colors, here's a quick flyover of what I've learned. The attached images show the spec sheets of two display panels - one is the stock display that comes on the A17, the other is a display panel from the same manufacturer, using the same size, interface connection (40 pin, .5mm eDP connection), but with HUGE differences in the color space - probably for only a little bit more in production cost. Note, I'm not an expert, and I'd love to hear from the Asus team why they made this choice, but the difference in color space is astounding. The stock display only shows 47% of the Adobe RGB color space, while the other one that I listed shows 75% of the Adobe RGB color space - that's a huge difference (see other images for explanations of color spaces and what colors this will affect on your screen - mostly reds and greens - and I found that reds are way off - look more orange because the display just can't physically display much of the red spectrum). So, for the trolls who might say, ""It's a gaming laptop, not a creator laptop,"" that is true - and it is advertised as such. But cost increase on those creator laptops is significant, so that's why I really had hoped this would work well for these applications. Now that I have this knowledge, I could have made a better decision perhaps. But I didn't have this information. It is VERY difficult to find these color space ratings (or even the stock manufacturer model of the display) to make the choice. I even e-mailed one manufacturer about the specifics of the color space on their laptop, and the rep didn't know... so this is the primary problem - finding the information. I wish that Amazon, or at least manufacturers, would make the listing of the NTSC or Adobe RGB or even the sRGB ratings a part of their listing - like stand-alone monitor manufacturers often do. So, why don't I return it? Well, I actually filled out the Amazon return and was ready to do just that, until I read the form that you get for return when you complete the process. There's a 20% re-stocking fee by this distributor... so I guess I'll have to live with this laptop. It's too bad, because it's like buying a brand-new corvette with a cracked and hazed over windshield that you can't replace - it drives great, you just can't really see where you are going... and that's the Asus TUF A17 for you when it comes to the display. If you do buy it, there is a cool setting in the Radeon software that controls the ""Import Snap Settings"" - so I can adjust the color settings for contrast, brightness, and hue, and then save that as a snap setting, which I can then import. So, I tweaked and made a few profiles for high contrast for office apps, best I could do for photos, and a few others. That helps take away the pain a little bit. SO, I hope this review helps someone make an informed decision. Meanwhile, Asus, if you're listening, please do better! My last laptop was an ASUS and I was thrilled with it. This one, not so much. That little 50 to 100 dollar corner you cut on the screen, and the failure to at least list this compromised color space on your specs, has seriously affected my view of your brand. Again, I hope this helps somebody. Have a great day!"
B0863DFMV7,5,Great Laptop,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27A8HJZAWWB78/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0863DFMV7," May 7, 2020",RestlessRaphael,Verified Purchase,"I have yet to see a review for the 120hz, 17.3"" screen, so i figured i would provide one. It comes as advertised with a few extras. I have only had this laptop for about 24 hours now, so take this review as you will. Out of the box, i decided to add another M.2 drive i had. The advertised pop-open screw did help, but it was still a pain to get a tool in the space to pop open the rest. After checking the box, i found it also came with a 2.5in SSD adapter with the motherboard flat cable (not sure what its called). It also came with 4 mounting screws. While it appears you can attach a 2.5"" to the motherboard, i could not find space for it to mount and have the bottom sealed again (perhaps a bit more research). The Ryzen 7 4800H processor is blazing fast comparative to my previous i7. The AC wifi has been consistent and pulling/pushing incredible speeds. I was able to dowload and install about a 1/2 TB worth of software, simultaneously, within about 90 to 120 min. This model does come with the ROG Amoury Crate software where you can manage profiles for your games. I found the fan noise is slightly better than that of my previous generation A17 TUF Gaming laptop. I find the adaptive sync screen is actually not as bad as everyone is saying. Amoury Crate profiles help to adjust your color balance and screen brightness quite well (i have yet to test games, but will within the next 24 hours). I have also ordered a DP to USB-C adapater, so i will let you know of VR compatability as well (Oculus Rift S). The sound is a bit better than previous generations as well, though still not great. As with the 15.6"" models, it also came with DTS Sound Unbound which works spectacular with my Bose QC35 headphones. Hope this was helpful to those considering this laptop. So far, i am extremely impressed and glad i waited for it. Best bang for buck as well!"

There's only one slot, so took out the 8 GB and put in 16 GB. Highly recommend the memory upgrade, there are YouTube videos on how but I recommend using a nearby tech professional since laptops these days are highly integrated. My only concern before buying was the display but it turned out to be pretty good. Attached a picture of my ThinkPad on the left and MacBook on the right for display comparison. I run video editing software, CAD software, coding software, everything runs very smooth and quiet.

The aesthetic isn‚Äôt overly gamer it‚Äôs just inconsistent. The MsI bird is green with red eyes and yet there‚Äôs other red accents and a red backlit keyboard. My logo actually came off so I ended up removing it completely. It could really do without the red accent lines and white backlighting on the budget model. That way MSI could use the same keyboard keys with the different backlight options...but I digress.

I can play WOW and other games without any issues. I can add another 8Gbs of Ram and it will run flawlessly. I gave it 3 stars because the alpha decal started peeling after 2 days and I keep this bundled up like a newborn when I'm not using it. I messaged the seller a week after receiving the product and asked for a new decal to install myself and got no reply. After a few months and getting tired of being stabbed everytime I removed the laptop from the case I decided to just take the decal off. If you look at the picture you can see some of the edges are bent up from where the decal was peeling up at. Due to the lack of customer service and the cosmetic inconvenience I'm giving it three stars. If im going to spend nearly a thousand dollars on a product I expect all of it to be top quality.

I would give the actual device a five star review. However, Google has changed things so that whereas I could always sign out of gmail and leave my website browser open - for other members of the family to look at and use, now you cannot sign out of gmail without signing out of the whole browser. As a parent who uses their laptop as access to the web for the whole family this does not work for me - everyone can see my gmail - or use my gmail! The only option I can see is to get a yahoo or other email account which would mean changing my whole email address (a pain in the neck) or getting a new laptop which was not Chromebook (waste of money!). Of course, in an ideal world everyone signs in and signs out of chromebook on their google account but in a family that doesn't happen and anyway that doesn't work with sharing website information I want my family to see on my browser (do they like these shoes/have they seen this youtube video/have they read the school homework website, etc.). At the moment I am getting around it by using the chromebook in guest mode only but then one might as well not have a chromebook (apart from the anti virus feature that is a strong selling point). I have no idea why Google changed this function recently - but as an unsophisticated computer purchaser (!) I thought I would share this problem with others who might use this laptop in the same way our family do, as it would never have occurred to me the problems this would cause when I decided to buy a Chromebook."

My only beef is niggling and cosmetic, and is obvious from the pictures; it has two USB ports and an audio port on the front, so those corresponding cables are more visible on my desk. The back is filled up with other ports, so they had to go in front. But I knew that going in. I got exactly what I thought I would get, and it works as well or better than I had expected it to.

Current laptops' commuting abilities make them usable for me for all my needs whether in the office, traveling, or in class. However, the small single laptop screen is not as easy to view with my eyes as it was 10 years ago. I bought a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon, Gen 7 based on previous good performance of an earlier Thinkpad. This docking station works well, but like most new laptops it connects via the super/lightening/all in one USB C connection. I would prefer the older style connector, but this most be the way PC makers want to go. The setup was fairly quick and worked almost like plug and play with my two existing monitors. I had to invest a few minutes to set up the monitor displays as I wanted, but this probably the case with any docking station. I looked at the cheaper knockoff docking stations, but was not impressed with their reviews. Some also do not charge the laptop which makes them almost worthless. This Lenovo branded dock was certainly not cheap and I probably paid a premium for the name. So far it is working as advertised to charge my laptop and seamlessly switch to the external monitors when I plug it into my laptop."

We thought it was an excellent deal at less than $250, but once we began the setup process, the laptop was ""laggy"" and painfully slow.

We ended up returning the laptop within a day, and purchased an Amazon ""renewed"" Dell Latitude which was much zippier and faster.

Got a SSD and 16 GB RAM for much less than other models. I know why it costs less. First hassle on the list is the fact that this computer comes with Windows 10 installed with ""S"" Mode enabled. This isn't a total deal breaker as it can be turned off if you can get connected to Microsoft without experiencing an error message that says, ""it appears you aren't connected to the internet"" even after having a connection to Wi-Fi. Once you install updates, and then reset windows store by typing into the search WSRESET and selecting WSRESET.EXE that fixes that issue. Now to hassle number 2, the internet connection was noticeably slower on this machine because it had a horrible WiFi network adapter installed on it. It doesn't recognize 5G networks, and is incredibly slow compared to other devices I have running on my network. To remedy this, it involves buying another adapter and installing it into the machine. It isn't too expensive, but this is 2020 and this computer was manufactured in 2019, so this is no excuse for HP to put such a terrible WiFi adapter in this thing. Other than those hassles, everything else seems to work fine. The machine boots up fast, runs and executes apps and programs quickly. You would be better off skipping this one for another budget laptop if you want hassle free setup. I purchased a Lenovo earlier in the year and didn't experience any of these issues.

All i wanted to do is use a USB device to run/install some programs and install a dual boot operating system, despite hours to get the BIOS to respond, this laptop refuses to recognize ANY USB device, any USB device, thumb drive, external dvd player, any USB device. Even with a purge of the BIOS, and complete reset of Windows 10, this machine refuses to recognize any USB device... A necessary feature in the bios , CSM fails to appear...unable to disable UEFI...and there's .more, which i wont bore you with. I spoke to Asus techs who told me the USB devices should be recognized if windows 10 was installed and active. This made no difference...enough. To say the least, i am disappointed. I have great respect for Asus brand products for desktop computers, but for this laptop, my first Asus laptop, two thumbs down."

For almost a 1k laptop, it lasted for only for 1 month. Keep in mind that my total gaming hours for each day was less than 3 hours. That's not even the worst part... Within a week of using it for less than 3 hours of gaming a day this product kept on crashing every time I closed out on Overwatch,CS:GO, and League of Legends. These games can be ran on a 6 year computer with a 610 graphics card. I'm not sure if this whole product is a defect or just mine. Either way I wouldn't risk 1k ever again on Asus gaming Laptops. Other than the fact that mine died within a month, which I'm upset about because it's 1k and it didn't even last 2 years? A desktop would've been a better choice! The laptop quality was decent,the graphics were decent, and the brightness was decent. The only cons excluding the crashes and burning out within a month, is the battery life. It has at max 3 hours of gaming unplugged.(but it's a gaming laptop so idk why you would want to unplug it)"

The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars from me are a few design options. the enlarged mouse pad is awkward and takes some getting used to. and the speakers are on the bottom front of the laptop firing downwards. not an ideal setup. 512gb of memory isn't enough, and the factory partitions it very weirdly. It's a lot easier to add storage to this laptop than to add RAM though so I've already added a 1tb SSD to the 2nd of 3 slots and undid their weird partitioning. otherwise I don't have anything to complain about. key travel is nice, screen is bright, RGB keyboard can be customized by key, and a lot of other features."

I'm primarily a gamer and wanted something that could push through games and not kill my ears with fan noise. So far the fans have been the quietest of any laptop I've tried, and trust me, I've tried alot. The GPU temps and CPU temps are very good. I'm an OCD type person, so if this laptop makes the smallest noise or has any minimal issue, I freak out.As of now, I have not one issue with this laptop except one, The Mouse track pad. When I type, I end up resting my hand on it and moves the pointer or I click the button and messes stuff up on the screen. But, that is not a deal breaker, I just have to be alittle more carefully where I rest my palms when I type. As for gaming, this 1660 ti is handling all my games beyond expectations. My FPS hangs around 100 to 120 on high or ultra settings in all my games. The screen is sharp and the response time is awesome. I do wish it was made of metal, but it's all plastic.

However, while running in maximum clock speed, CPU temperatures hit and stay on 94-95¬∞C, which may lead to wearing of the CPU in long run. I did not felt comfortable staying on those temperatures, unlike GPU where the temperatures were nice and cool under 75¬∞C. I heard that issue might be the poor quality of thermal paste MSI uses in their laptops which leads to high temperatures. Until I find a solution, I will disable turbo clock speed of CPU to keep it cool. Other than that, laptop did not have any issues. If CPU ran cooler than it did, I would have given 5 stars."

I am NOT a tech savvy person, so it's important to me to find simple solutions to problems. The quick start guide is pretty much plug and go (a good thing). But then the hoops appear. There is no printed owner's manual. There IS an owner's manual in the Dragon Center, which I found by accident. But this is a generic MSI manual, and each model has it's own quirks. My first concern was that the lighted keyboard continued to flash colors, which I could not change. This model does NOT have an LED wizard to change the keyboard lights, and nowhere in the Dragon Center is this addressed. I checked the online forms, which all refer to the LED wizard. Went to the on-line help desk for MSI, but you have to register the laptop to get any support; to register I needed to supply a copy of the invoice, which I do not have. Called the MSI helpline, to explain the issue; they got it registered and then sort of talked me through changing the back-lighting. The path he gave me was not exactly the path that is on this comp, but it worked (you have to go through the Steel Keyboard file).

I am happy so far with the laptop it even has a DVD player which most are dropping. I don't watch DVD's but do use the player to record data to DVD's like photos and other data. I don't game online so can't say it is good for that probably not first pick for that but as a general use for people like me who mostly read emails and news online it is perfect!

The RGB lighting is meh to me and happy I can turn it off and have only turned it on when I'm showing someone the inside of this beast. Will update review if anything else changes. Would I buy it again? Yes."

Even if you are not a gamer, and are unfamiliar with OBLIVION, its a pretty good indication of a solid pc that this game runs well on this device. I've also been doing regular business on it as well, no complaints. The screen is plenty large, and crisp enough. I paid $300 for mine, and think that was a great value (I actually bought 2, one for the wife as well). Keyboard is nice, track pad works good, but I find a regular mouse is even better.

These will make the laptop run really fast! When I received my laptop, I couldn't control the screen brightness and I couldn't control the night light. It thought this computer is malfunction; but after I install new updates for my computer it solves the problems. I am so happy, and I like this laptop so much.

Even though I bought this on Amazon, the company that sold it buys the laptops from Lonovo, then doubles the RAM, eliminates the bloatware, updates all the drives and streamlines the machine for speed. They then repack the machine and ship it for considerably less than Lenovo sells the computer for retail without the enhancements. It saved me time and headaches setting the machine up and the increased RAM and lack of bloatware make it extremely fast. By adding a SP solid state 2TB drive that I connect to the computer, I have more storage, it is removable, and costs less than half that of a comparable computer with 1TB installed storage. This was the deal of the decade!!!"

Didn't have a big budget for a new device and just needed a laptop with good battery life & that would run MS Office and do web. Also, wanted a 15"" screen for my eyes. Didn't know what to expect, I ordered the model with 8 GB of RAM & a 256 GB SSD. Laptop arrived with Windows 10 Pro. I installed MS Office, Chrome, & a few other applications which I'd need for school Also installed Norton Internet Security. After minimal updating/configuring, I tested the setup out. It works great. Time will tell if it lasts. Otherwise a nice little laptop for class, couldn't be happier. Screen resolution could be better, but it is not bad, it is adequate. I haven't had the chance to use the HDMI port to output to my 27 inch HD monitor yet though. I'd certainly recommend this device for anyone who needs a basic laptop for school, small business, or home use. Would be great for kids. I would definitely buy a model with 8 GB of RAM based on the RAM usage I saw in Task Manager. For a $335 laptop everything is great, can''t complain here. Great job guys. BW"

It took hours to download Chrome and then it could not find my personal account. It is certainly not the dell xps 15 I have used in stores prior to purchasing this. Buy this machine if you want to wait over 5 minutes to open a new tab tab and to waste good money on absolute junk. Dell needs to pull these computers before their reputation is tainted for good. Do yourself a favor and buy HP Spectre 360 15 which is cheaper or the Dell Inspiron 7000 series (much cheaper) or even the Dell Inspiron 5000 series (half the price) All have 13 and 15, and Dells have 17, all touchscreens and perform much better than this. The positives: Screen and feel of keyboard and touch pad but makes no difference if you are going to stare at a blank screen waiting to load a web page. This model computer is rated #1 for 15 inch on most sites but this product on here is not it, this is defective. It was so slow to open up my Amazon tab that I was able to plug in, start up and get to Amazon quicker on my other computer. Received this item today and it is being reset (I dread how much time that will take) and packaged up to be returned. I am also contacting Dell to make them aware of this."

The first one I received within a couple of minutes had numerous discolored vertical lines in a two inch slice of the screen, which persisted through reboots and were visible in BIOS and in a separate boot environment. The replacement I received looks to have been previously returned based on the manufacturer tape being split and covered with regular shipping tape, and it too had a screen issue. Backlight bled up from the bezel, which may not be a dealbreaker if this was a $300 laptop, but I'm not paying $1800 for a laptop with a screen with ANY defects."

I purchased a gaming laptop to edit 4k videos, to run Adobe filters, and run intense trading algorithms. That being said, I HATE the keyboard. The AWS & d keys are white, which looks so tacky. Next the font of all the letters of the keyboard is wierd and gamer like, a normal person can hardly tell what the letters are the font is so far off normal. Lately the delete key is not over the backspace key, it's over 1 key, why on earth change that, I have to go looking for it all the time and because I can hardly read the keys am always missing it. The camo design is also super cheesy the fake carbon fiber too. The computer is fast, it's as big and heavy as my 5 year old Toshiba satellite that I am replacing, I was expecting a 17"" laptop to be thinner after 5 years especially now that the CD rom is gone. All in all it's a good laptop which is fully on and ready 5 seconds after opening it, I just wish whoever designed the keyboard would be fired or maybe executed idk. I also think its annoying that not even a gamer designed laptop can be free of a ton of bloatware. I mean really does Asus make that much money from annoying its customers with all the unneeded programs preinstalled. The battery life is awful too. The shortest of any laptop I think I've ever had. Ok so bottom line it's not perfect but I like the quality and speed of this laptop.... just keep it plugged in and dont look down! The end."

Most game on typical setting people would play then with for performance instead of pure visual(which it is capable of for a huge amount of games) it easily outputs greater than 145fps. In most cases I get around 160-260fps depending on the game being played and which settings are used. The air cooling is one of the absolute best I've ever seen, rarely ever does the GPU hit 80 Celsius while gaming for long periods. The biggest and pretty much the only downfall of this laptop is the OC settings are barely there...you can't OC it much higher than it is already at as most settings are perma locked while trying to OC the GPU off the start. I would still highly recommend this this purchase for those with the cash to spend, and want the closest thing to a portable desktop."

People need to know about this. Will post on other products as well. Mine is the MSI GT75 Titan-055. Within 2 months of purchase, it stopped recognizing it was plugged into power, battery died, wouldn't charge, and wouldn't turn on. I called customer service and asked if mechanical problems happen a lot with these laptops, they said no (a lie). They make you pay for shipping to get repaired and repairs take a month (they don't allow you to pay more to get it expedited, even if you use it for work). Within a month of receiving the repaired laptop, it broke again in the exact same way. I emailed customer service and asked if I could extend my warranty, get a replacement, or just cut my losses and try to return it for half price bc I received a defective product. They said the warranty only covers repairs, no replacement, they don't accept returns, and you can only extend your warranty within 3 months of purchase. First of all, they make this fact very hard to discover and they never made that clear when I registered my product, I only discovered it after google searching following the second breakdown. Even then, I couldn't figure out how to do it on their website, they likely only do it if you take the initiative to find out they even offer it and then call yourself. Since they had it for an entire month repairing it the first time, a month that effectively ran out the clock on my chance to extend the warranty, I couldn't really know I would really really need that extended warranty until it broke again. I did extensive research and discovered these kinds of mechanical failures are very common. Either they use cheap parts or just don't pay much attention to build quality and/or testing. Now I'm out $3500 with a laptop that will likely keep breaking periodically, each time taking a month to repair, and then after my 12 month warranty is up, it will be up to me to shell out hundreds-thousands of dollars more to get it fixed regularly. More people need to know that there is a fairly strong chance they will get bilked out of thousands of dollars and MSI will stick dogmatically to their ""policy"" of not accepting returns on defective products, not replacing the product outright and instead putting bandaids on their fundamentally flawed machines, and shady practice of hiding the ability to extend your warranty until it's too late. Even if you offer to pay a lot of money to get them to bend the rules on their ""policy."" They know that the cost of repairs will become too much for them and they want to dump the responsibility on you as fast as possible."

Single color red lit back keyboard. Latop is pretty light. Screen itself is nice and sharp and does run at 120hz. Seems like a solid laptop until you start playing games on it. The FPS is extremely disappointing for what it is. BFV i would get an average FPS of 70-80 on medium settings. Apex would get average 90-100 on low settings. I do have raytracing turned off on BFV and all my settings are set to performance within the nivdia control panel and the power options. The dragon center was also set to performance. Comparing benchmarks with other rtx 2060 cards, the performance is about half of what is expected. I'm going to assume that the i5 8300h is bottlenecking the GPU. I did a clean reinstall of windows and still got the same results. The nividia drivers are up to date. TBH its a waste of money. You're buying a 2060 laptop with 1050 performance. Ending up returning this and getting the 8750h version. Also another downside is that you cannot add another internal HDD without breaking the factory warrant seal. I ended up using a external HD to make more room. What's also annoying is that the 256 gb pcie card is partitioned into 2 drives. The CPU temps average around 80 -85 C with the gpu temps averaging around 75c. The cooler boost is annoyingly loud. Now with the temps reaching that high you wont be able to feel which is a plus. Now if there's a fix that would be nice but it should not be running like this right off the bat."

The ability to hook up three 4K monitors at 60Hz with out a docking station means that productivity can happen any where there is a monitor and any of the 3 cable types. Also no docking station required if that is your choice. I will be pairing this with a thunderbolt 3 dock and the Mini Display port option on the laptop to drive my triple monitor setup. only 3 cables all on the same side will allow for a desktop experience that can travel when I need to. With a battery life that allows for 6 to 7 hours of cord free productivity it is a power house that can satisfy my urge for the occasional game. Hitting over 120 frames on ultra settings @ 1080p in the games I like to play(Starcraft II) means that I can even be bold enough to scale up to an external monitor.

In addition, some of my instructors just give us the scanned copies of the assignments on iLearn and the touch screen ability with the Wacom pen is really useful for taking a full screen snip and writing on it using the ""whiteboard"" app. I've had no problems with it so far and doubt that I'll have any anytime soon. There are only 2 usb ports which I've only found an issue with once, but I am glad that it has an hdmi port as well, SD card slot, and one for the jack. There is also another one that looks like a type c charge, but I don't know what its for and haven't needed it so its not that important for me. Most of the ports are on the right side and I'd personally prefer them on the left, but they're not that bothersome. I also love the fingerprint feature on this thing! It can also flip all the way back and be used in tablet mode, there is even a Microsoft store to install things that you would normally have on a tablet.

So I would never buy this I‚Äôve been through hell several several phone calls begging with them to find my computer them Being rude to me because they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing there and now I have this computer that‚Äôs already been taken apart the data is gone so I can‚Äôt even restore my pictures my information nothing I can‚Äôt get a hold of anyone to do anything about it if anyone knows any way I can talk to an actual life person that understands English please let me know"

I inserted different memory cards but none of them were detected/read. Did research online about what could the problem be but since I am not really a techie, I could only go so far. The device manager does not show any driver for the Realtek Card Reader ( which this laptop is supposed to have, as shown in the Dell Support website), and though I tried several times to download the driver from the support site, nothing ever showed in the Device Manager. Another method I used from the online support site is to have it specifically detect the driver, but again No driver detected! Could it be that the driver was installed somewhere else inside the laptop? Possibly. But hey, as a customer, why would I be handed this headache when I paid the full amount they asked? Why ship this unit without making sure that everything was working? I suspect that this is a renewed unit and maybe when they're refurbishing this, they incorrectly attached the physical memory card port. I wish I knew the right answer to this. One more thing, the specs re the hard drive is confusing. I thought I was getting a laptop with an SSD drive along with the 1TB HDD. Checking the device manager, I realized that no SSD was included. The seller wasn't clearly up front with what were excluded compared to those new units sold from Dell itself."

On initial boot-up I got an error message saying that it had been interrupted and needed to be restarted to reinstall Windows. A restart only got the same message. I started hitting the F keys on boot-up until I got into system recovery and from there reinstalled Windows. After everything was up I realized the back-lighting on the keyboard was not working. I turned the computer over to get the product code and saw the factory seal on the bottom was cut. When attempting to get a replacement I was informed it wasn't eligible for replacement. I had used my Amazon card for the special financing and the only way I can get it again is to return it and wait for the refund then reorder.

I‚Äôve had other brands like Dell and HP. MSI is much better over all for features and speed options. My first MSI failed, not because of hardware but because of a separate software issue. I bought both to edit video and photos, not game. The led keyboard with key by key assignable color is brilliant to remind you of which key do what function. I like the ergonomics better than my other MSI. It‚Äôs smaller and lighter than my 17 inch, but doesn‚Äôt feel like it. I like the curve at the palm of the mousepad so much more. The lid‚Äôs led lights are a cool gimmick that I never see. It‚Äôs very fast so far! I can run Adobe CC, Vegas Pro, and DaVinci Resolve very well. One issue I have seen so far when editing video or photos is the screen calibration. There are various MSI schemes and initially I chose ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù thinking it would work best but it made some of my old pics and videos look terrible. I found the MSI True Color Panel and switched to sRGB and it looks right again. Render speeds for 1080p video were speedy. Of course, It‚Äôs only been a week so we‚Äôll see."

The USBC ports appear to be just that, USB. All of my usability complaints are related to windows 10. I am not saying ""Windows sucks"", it just isn't what I am used to.

I reinstalled Windows 10, using the ""local"" option, so not from the internet, but it's 2004 somehow. There are no options in the settings to roll back and MyAsus also provides no guidance.

I decided to go with the RX 2080 GPU so as to get as many years out of this thing going forward as I possibly can, obviously the GPU blows away anything I'm trying to use it for now. I'm not an expert so I just plugged and played World of Warships with max'ed out settings and was getting 75 fps on average, good enough for me to be impressed.

The first one I received within a couple of minutes had numerous discolored vertical lines in a two inch slice of the screen, which persisted through reboots and were visible in BIOS and in a separate boot environment. The replacement I received looks to have been previously returned based on the manufacturer tape being split and covered with regular shipping tape, and it too had a screen issue. Backlight bled up from the bezel, which may not be a dealbreaker if this was a $300 laptop, but I'm not paying $1800 for a laptop with a screen with ANY defects."

I purchased a gaming laptop to edit 4k videos, to run Adobe filters, and run intense trading algorithms. That being said, I HATE the keyboard. The AWS & d keys are white, which looks so tacky. Next the font of all the letters of the keyboard is wierd and gamer like, a normal person can hardly tell what the letters are the font is so far off normal. Lately the delete key is not over the backspace key, it's over 1 key, why on earth change that, I have to go looking for it all the time and because I can hardly read the keys am always missing it. The camo design is also super cheesy the fake carbon fiber too. The computer is fast, it's as big and heavy as my 5 year old Toshiba satellite that I am replacing, I was expecting a 17"" laptop to be thinner after 5 years especially now that the CD rom is gone. All in all it's a good laptop which is fully on and ready 5 seconds after opening it, I just wish whoever designed the keyboard would be fired or maybe executed idk. I also think its annoying that not even a gamer designed laptop can be free of a ton of bloatware. I mean really does Asus make that much money from annoying its customers with all the unneeded programs preinstalled. The battery life is awful too. The shortest of any laptop I think I've ever had. Ok so bottom line it's not perfect but I like the quality and speed of this laptop.... just keep it plugged in and dont look down! The end."

Really liked this laptop and was looking forward experiencing this but I will be sticking with Apple next time for sure.

I am thrilled that I was able to find a computer in the configuration that I wanted for a very reasonable price as my needs for the new computer or very specific in order to make it somewhat future-proof (at least for a few years). I shopped around all over the web to try to find a computer that would suit these very specific needs and was very pleased to find it on Amazon without having to sacrifice any of my particular specifications. The company that sells their computers through Amazon had many different configurations with regard to RAM, hard disk size, Windows version and more and I actually bought a machine that was better than I intended because of the price."

I‚Äôve got it setup with two monitors (one HDMI to HDMI and another HDMI to USB-C) and that works great. I have a Bluetooth speaker that is connected to it for audio out. Make sure you‚Äôve got some sort of audio system in mind and don‚Äôt rely on the built-in mic for anything if you need a microphone for any reason. I wish the options were a little more open for better processing power and graphics, but that‚Äôs the trade-off in scaling down the size of the PC.

It was purchased for a student who has a chromebook at school so she was using it immediately and very thrilled to have it. The Amazon description doesn't have a model number but the paperwork says it is a C330. I'm thinking it's a newer version of the model since the description says it came out in November 2018 and there aren't any reviews yet. The C330 model 81HY0000US is listed as being released on Aug 2018 and I read those reviews before purchasing. I took a chance getting something without a review because it had a similar description to the C330 and it was able to arrive within 2 days. The white color is very nice, the weight is nice and it seems sturdy. There were remarks on the C330 reviews about settling for a resolution that wasn't as good as others, but I think the graphics are just fine. The keyboard has a nice touch and it has many features I was looking for - a touch screen; blue tooth; and being able to fold it to use as a tablet. Bonus: it sits in other positions for easy movie viewing; HDMI; USB slots, SD slot; camera, etc... I know you can get a more basic Chromebook for $150 - $200 but it was work paying $250 to get all of these extra features. I just can't see getting one without a touch screen. I don't know if the 32 GB instead of 64 GB is going to be an issue. We haven't tried to load any apps yet."

It is a Chromebook so its all relative but for what she uses it for it performs flawlessly. The touch screen is responsive and easy to use. Screen is bright and google play apps (which is a big plus as Chromebook specific apps are limited and frankly poorly ported) appear to perform just as well as on her Pixel 2. The only complaint really is compared to her old Chromebook this thing feels like its made of lead. Not a huge deal if on a desk or on your lap, does however give your arms a work out if you are holding it in a tablet configuration. All in all though it is a great buy at $249 and more than any thing she is happy with it, which hell lets be honest is more important than anything."

They are really nice laptops except that they have issues. When we first received them, one was not working at all due to it stating it needed to have an operating system installed. After clicking through some tests, it did indeed have Windows 10 installed but apparently a corrupt install. Once we got in and saw it had Windows 10, we attempted to use it but it kept restarting every 3 to 4 minutes. The 2nd laptop started up just fine. However in the past 3 weeks of having it, it too has reatarted randomly about 1 to 2 times a week which makes it extremely difficult if in the middle of a complex photo edit. Also, that one does not have the Microsoft store that should be a part of Windows or the photo app. We contacted the seller about the first laptop which was basically DOA and they sent us a Windows recovery thumb drive which did not correct the problems. They then sent us a UPS label to return the laptop for an exchange. We received another laptop but have no way of knowing if it is a replacement or the same one with Windows reinstalled. In any case, it too now randomly restarts 1 to 2 a week. We will go to a local computer store to have Windows 10 reinstalled on both laptops as we do not trust the seller. These are very expensive laptops and we should be able to expect and receive a laptop in exceptional working order which did not happen. Perhaps a run of bad luck if it was one laptop but two laptops....that is a problem as we see it. We will not recommend this seller to anyone we know. Lesson learned...we will buy local from now on regarding computer equipment."

They are really nice laptops except that they have issues. When we first received them, one was not working at all due to it stating it needed to have an operating system installed. After clicking through some tests, it did indeed have Windows 10 installed but apparently a corrupt install. Once we got in and saw it had Windows 10, we attempted to use it but it kept restarting every 3 to 4 minutes. The 2nd laptop started up just fine. However in the past 3 weeks of having it, it too has reatarted randomly about 1 to 2 times a week which makes it extremely difficult if in the middle of a complex photo edit. Also, that one does not have the Microsoft store that should be a part of Windows or the photo app. We contacted the seller about the first laptop which was basically DOA and they sent us a Windows recovery thumb drive which did not correct the problems. They then sent us a UPS label to return the laptop for an exchange. We received another laptop but have no way of knowing if it is a replacement or the same one with Windows reinstalled. In any case, it too now randomly restarts 1 to 2 a week. We will go to a local computer store to have Windows 10 reinstalled on both laptops as we do not trust the seller. These are very expensive laptops and we should be able to expect and receive a laptop in exceptional working order which did not happen. Perhaps a run of bad luck if it was one laptop but two laptops....that is a problem as we see it. We will not recommend this seller to anyone we know. Lesson learned...we will buy local from now on regarding computer equipment."

B07JHZX4GH,5,Chromebook (Pixelbook) dual monitor with charging.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DQ90KJKNC28W/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07JHZX4GH," August 9, 2019",Needelander,Verified Purchase,"I was having an issue finding a dock that would display dual external monitors for a Chromebook-Pixelbook (correctly). Purchased a few different options that all had their drawbacks or issues. First, I'll cover the good items for the Wavlink dock and how it was different than other options I tried. First, I'm able to display two external monitors at 2560x1440. This includes the option of having the Pixelbook open for a third screen or closed and working only from the dual monitors. Most other docks I tried would either not display both external monitors at all times or have issues with the resolution/scaling. Second, is that it charges the Pixelbook through the same USB-C connection. This was not guaranteed due to the hardware of the Pixelbook. This is huge for me as I don't have to have a connection for power and then the connection for the dock separate. I've also used this same dock with a Dell Precision laptop and it works just as well (you'll see it under the Pixelbook in the picture). Also, I really like that it is horizontal or ""flat"" on my desk. Some of the other options are vertical, which doesn't really fit well with my movable dual monitors."

However, this ultimately limited me to only 2 Thunderbolt ports and left me looking for some additional expansion. I'd tried a couple of different Thunderbolt ""Hubs"" on the market and (while effective), they were just unsightly with a lot of cables running out of them and even with one of the better ones, I eventually ran out of available ports that I was needing. So I decided to drop the money to get a true Dock. I did a lot of research for compatible docks and the biggest thing that kept turning me away was price. I don't do any real pro work on my machine, so was difficult for me to justify some of the $250-$350+ solutions. I came across this brand and after reviewing many of the specs, liked what it offered for the price. And I must say I am very satisfied with the purchase! It's provided me all of the ports I currently need with some excess remaining! I'm currently running a 34"" LG Ultra-wide Monitor via DP, a 24"" Dell HD Monitor in vertical set-up (*more on that later) via DVI to HDMI input, Audio out to an audio switch, Gigabit Ethernet in and several USB peripherals, all via one Thunderbolt port which also provides power to my MacBook Pro! That leaves me with an additional 2 USB 3.0 Ports and 2 USB-C Port on the front of the device and one open Thunderbolt port on my MacBook!"

Got a new one and it's been working for me since. I immediately put Linux on it and it was working so well. Sadly, however, I had to move back to Windows 10 because I needed to use my game capture device on it and it won't under Linux. Either way, it's fast, beautiful, keyboard is nice and feels good under my fingers. Mouse trackpad is a bit...wonky, but get yourself a cheap Logitech wireless mouse and all that goes away. The HDMI output port is perfect when I need to hook it up to a monitor or my TV. Wifi works well and the Ethernet port is good in case I don't have access to wifi, but do have access to a physical connection. I have not been able to test out the USB-C connector, but I'm sure it's fine. USB 3 and 2 ports work as intended with no issue. SD Card slot also works beautifully. It's pretty lightweight compared to my last laptop, a nearly 10 year old Dell Inspirion. Battery life could be better, but I usually have it plugged in, so it's not too big an issue. One thing to look out for, though. No removeable battery, so if it fails up, be prepared."

Not tested on games, and not going to. This unit is intended to provide relief from a smallish screen on a very slick cardboard-thin fancy laptop, and it performs well with several Word and PowerPoint windows open, + PyMol or YASARA Dynamics. Actually runs some molecular dynamics simulations (in YASARA), and other scientific soft. No touchscreen (good), no backlight on keys (OK). Not a bad-looking unit, considering the price."

I am very happy as a student using this for college. I do half of my classes online so I use this a lot! It‚Äôs been so reliable and easy to use. The battery life is even pretty accurate.

This laptop is OK if you only need something for browsing but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for games, even fairly lightweight ones. Lack of a keypad was surprising but I‚Äôve adapted and I like that the screen resolution is higher than my old laptop‚Äîthough you will need to change this in settings as by default it seems like the resolution is set to a lower setting and it makes text and interface elements really blurry. Overall a good purchase and a good machine I will be using in the foreseeable future, but I will probably replace with something that has slightly more power for when I am not traveling."

At first the battery took forever to recharge and then it stopped charging all together. When she called Amazon, they only had a 30 day warranty so she called the manufacturer - they only had a 120 day warranty. According to the customer service rep she spoke with, if the battery cell gets below a certain level and is plugged up to charge, it will blow the ""main board"". All they said was ""sorry"".

The first one I received within a couple of minutes had numerous discolored vertical lines in a two inch slice of the screen, which persisted through reboots and were visible in BIOS and in a separate boot environment. The replacement I received looks to have been previously returned based on the manufacturer tape being split and covered with regular shipping tape, and it too had a screen issue. Backlight bled up from the bezel, which may not be a dealbreaker if this was a $300 laptop, but I'm not paying $1800 for a laptop with a screen with ANY defects."

I purchased a gaming laptop to edit 4k videos, to run Adobe filters, and run intense trading algorithms. That being said, I HATE the keyboard. The AWS & d keys are white, which looks so tacky. Next the font of all the letters of the keyboard is wierd and gamer like, a normal person can hardly tell what the letters are the font is so far off normal. Lately the delete key is not over the backspace key, it's over 1 key, why on earth change that, I have to go looking for it all the time and because I can hardly read the keys am always missing it. The camo design is also super cheesy the fake carbon fiber too. The computer is fast, it's as big and heavy as my 5 year old Toshiba satellite that I am replacing, I was expecting a 17"" laptop to be thinner after 5 years especially now that the CD rom is gone. All in all it's a good laptop which is fully on and ready 5 seconds after opening it, I just wish whoever designed the keyboard would be fired or maybe executed idk. I also think its annoying that not even a gamer designed laptop can be free of a ton of bloatware. I mean really does Asus make that much money from annoying its customers with all the unneeded programs preinstalled. The battery life is awful too. The shortest of any laptop I think I've ever had. Ok so bottom line it's not perfect but I like the quality and speed of this laptop.... just keep it plugged in and dont look down! The end."
B07GMYLF7H,4,Zippy little machine with a couple drawbacks,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S0GDCMWQS53Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07GMYLF7H," September 4, 2019",Laelia,Verified Purchase,"So far pretty good. This is a pretty zippy little machine - I'm fairly impressed with it's quick boot time, and generally it hasn't lagged with any task thus far. Keyboard is satisfying (and thankfully is backlit), thin bezel is a nice touch, machine is very light, slim and trim. My complaints are the same as what is found in some review articles: 1) The battery life is absolutely dismal - I can literally watch the battery life slip away as I'm working, and while I haven't tried running it down yet, I don't think it can last more than 4 hours - which sort of defeats the purpose of a very portable machine. 2) The display resolution is awful- 1366 x 768 - that Lenovo made this machine without FHD is kind of mind-boggling - and it's pretty darn noticeable. Strangely though, while my eyes are usually very sensitive to low-res, it isn't bothering me _that_ much. I bought this computer in a bit of a rush, and had I noticed the battery and screen specs before purchase, I would not have purchased, and I imagine these specs would be a deal-killer for many other folks. Nonetheless, I'm pretty happy with the laptop overall."

I‚Äôve tried to ‚Äúimprove recognition‚Äù by using different looks and hair styles and it still won‚Äôt recognize me. I have to type my password every time.

It doesn't. C drive is 28 gb; D drive is about 460 gb. Close, and the internal structure could use up the difference. The problem is that C drive is only large enough for Windows and Office and a few other files, but it took a week for me to fill it to the point that no more data could be placed there. Trying to move files and data from C to D didn't work, either by using a USB drive or by cut/copy/paste. Amazon had no problem authorizing a return, but the 3d party provider wants me to pay for the return, plus a 20% restocking fee, or more if the package is open or used. Of course it had to be opened and used to discover the problem. The laptop was sold to me by Electroinc; now the same item and unchanged listing is sold by another company. Locating the companies in Canada was not difficult, but the phone numbers are no good, so tech service is non-existent, Beware."

I have probably had at least 10 service sessions with HP and the problems have never been resolved. The HP service techs have remoted into my computer at least 8 times.

These fans are nice but fan speed can‚Äôt be controlled. My fan controller fried and now the fans are worthless cannot even control with other Thermaltake controllers. This is a joke. He cable management is poor and if you have to add other controller or fan hubs. Good luck. I have built dozen of PCs. This is up there with worst I have experienced.

I chose it because it seems the most easily stackable model, the versatile top choices, and the price was right... And it's one of the most attractive cars in its size class that won't break the bank. I loved the idea of this case. It's beautiful and smartly designed. But, I really wish it came as an ITX size or SFF. I was hoping that since it's micro atx, it'd be smaller than a tower, but the squat, fat shape breaks it for me. Instead of being long and thin like a full tower, it's short and squat. About the same space taken up, but in a different way. The case is, without a doubt, huge in person in a way you can't really perceive in your head when it crunches the size numbers. It's like your single aunt fey's pug. It's cute until you realize how massively over fed it is, lol. Unfortunately I'll be sending it back, but it really is a beautiful case if you have the space. The tempered glass survived shipping with hardly any protection and it really looks just like the picture."

However, I was worried when I opened the box and found two capacitors already bent while still in the anti-static bag, and it looked like the bag itself was scuffed from shuffling in the box or something, as the bottom of it had drag marks from the metal on the bottom of the board. I decided to hope for the best and see if it would work once I assembled everything. Sadly today, after 4 hours of installing it, testing it, taking it back out, testing it without anything but bare essentials in, attempting to reset CMOS, etc., it refused to boot to POST. The BIOS would never boot up and no matter what I tried, the mobo was stuck in an infinite boot loop. I even tried booting it off the case, if it might have just been shorting the board somehow, but no luck there either. As other reviews have said, ASRock's quality control seems to leave a lot to be desired. While I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt that I simply got a bad board, which happens all the time with motherboards, multiple reviews seem to indicate that this is a problem with this board, or potentially ASRock in general."

I have purchased two of these, one directly from HP and the other from Amazon, and both demonstrated this issue. I added a tiny bit of special adhesive glue, and it did not interfere with operation.

When the computer wakes up from either hibernate or sleep there are intermittent BSODs and the docking station will often start glitching (the mouse will start lagging and the audio out of the station's headphone jack will have static). The workaround I have found for that is to unplug the laptop from the docking station before bringing it out of hibernate/sleep and then plugging it back in once the computer is active. When I bought this thing I thought I'd be able to just tap the top of the dock to kick everything on but no such luck because of these issues.

The only issue is that it took me a while to figure out the top cover which is a button that turns on the computer. If it's lit, hitting the button turns your computer off, so don't hit it again.

The fingerprint reader in particular has proven solid for logging in, and while it's less than a month old, I haven't had any immediate issues yet, so I'll keep my fingers crossed. As far as packaging, it arrived well-packaged with all the expected parts and came out of the box ready to play. Installation of all of my needs for it (not insubstantial) was a fair bit quicker than I expected, and rather than leaving it overnight to manage all its updates, I found myself feeling like I might have forgotten something because it ran through all the paces so quickly.

Bought this computer a little over a year ago. Six months in, the internal battery died. One year in, the computer became completely nonfunctional. Constant freezing and crashing, serious challenges updating the OS, battery failure, constant screen blackouts, entire days when the computer refused to turn on, the computer was struggling to run basic programs--literally struggling with internet browsers and Microsoft Word, let alone any actual heavy duty programs. Have taken the laptop to my university's tech department four times, only for them to inform me that parts of this laptop appear to have been replaced with older parts. Tech department was continuously surprised when I mentioned how new the laptop was. I was sold a defective device, and no party has accepted any real responsibility. This was already a serious financial stretch for a piece of equipment I need every single day for university. Completely unacceptable, has caused me a ton of stress and frustration.

I'm looking into getting a new computer as mine is only a couple years old and I can't stand it anymore. I bought it for video editing and it is just about useless for that. I bought it directly from Lenovo and don't understand how they build computers that have the capacity to run Premiere Pro, as in processor speed, video card, and RAM that are supposed to be enough to handle video, yet I get maybe two seconds of playback in PP before the video freezes, and sometimes the audio freezes as well, even when set to the lowest possible resolution for playback. The processor is always maxed out, even when I'm only running a browser and one program. Ever since I got it, if you bump the computer at all while playing a video file the video freezes with digital glitches all over the video image, which is probably due to the cheap hard drive. It may not be solid state, but I've never had this problem with any other SATA drives."

I was warned a long time ago though, that gaming laptops aren't so great at multitasking. With the HP Omen having twice the power of my old HP, I thought this would be better. I still can't play Street Fighter 5 on this and I couldn't on my old one. It has trouble working with large Window's Paint files, while my old HP didn't really.

The positive reviews outweighed the negative, the description of it seemed on point, everything seemed great. Then I received it. Upon unboxing it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised by the shear size and weight of it. It was definitely heavier than most other laptops I owned in the past and it had a much larger screen size than I was expecting. Obviously, neither of of these characteristics were bad in my opinion, just a little unexpected is all. However, the real problems came AFTER I had turned it on and installed all the essentials. After installing the essentials such as Windows and the numerous different drivers required, I began testing the laptop out to see JUST how effective it'd be with simple, lightweight tasks such as web browsing and video streaming. I was NOT pleased. I had installed Google Chrome, as I do with all my computers, however, simply opening the app proved to be a difficult task in itself for this laptop. It'd take anywhere between 10 to about 20 seconds JUST to open Google Chrome. Sometimes it could take longer depending on whether or not you're trying to open it soon after powering on the laptop. If you power on the device, THEN try to open Google Chrome shortly there after, it would take anywhere between 20 to around 30 SECONDS! This, as most of you know, is unacceptable for modern day PCs, especially ones of this caliber."

I now just know which color is where I like to be 90% of the time and if I have a setting I like for a particular game I just know what color to jump to.

I at first thought the issue was my system; However, when I changed the mouse to a super cheap one, I had no issues. I am NOT slamming any products from HP with this review. I further will not return the product to Amazon as I would really like to figure out the root cause of the issue. I just would like other gaming people to understand there may be issues with the ""out of the box"" performance of this mouse.

Two downsides in particular that may only apply to me, and one is just a very minor nitpick. First, for me at least, one of my more natural resting positions makes it so the mouse wheel is a good finger joint too short so I have to reach up to scroll, but I am sure I will adjust to it overtime. Second thing is found out I need Windows 10 to get the Omen Command Center to program the mouse. Currently I have Windows 8, but I plan on making a new computer entirely within the next few months, which will have Windows 10, so it is just a small gripe but maybe something to consider if you aren't yet modernized as I am. Other than those two things though it is a very good mouse, very accurate so that is lovely. I was able to use it perfectly straight out of the box. Another bonus is the cable is sturdy and durable looking as well. I would recommend."

I was warned a long time ago though, that gaming laptops aren't so great at multitasking. With the HP Omen having twice the power of my old HP, I thought this would be better.

At the end of the day, this laptop does perform as advertised and is light, great battery life and does the best it can with what it has to work with.

I did get USB C hub, so I can connect to Ethernet at the office, and 32 inch 4K monitor. As well as external KB and mouse. Resolution is 4K on laptop, perfect for my needs. I did run into a problem with Acronis True Image 2019 backup, but that is not an issue with the laptop. I am waiting on Acronis tech support to resolve that today hopefully.

The core I7 8550U Kaby-Lake processor is the same one you'll find in most high-end laptops these days, and better that the Y processors in the new macbook air. It has a generous number of connections; full size HDMI, USB 3, Usb2.1 and USB-C (3.1 specs), along with a Micro-SD slot and a 3.5mm headphone /microphone jack. The screen is a non-touch 1080P and a backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader. All in a 2.6 lb (by my scale) aluminum package. I have read some criticism of the keyboard, but personally I find it as good as any laptop keyboard and have no complaints. But, I do not write novels or technical manuals for a living so my typing is pretty basic and your mileage may vary. The down-firing Harmon Kardon branded speakers are OK. But in my opinion, people who insist on blasting there speakers for sound either live alone or don't mind annoying people around them. I have always preferred headphones."

I spent a lot of time reviewing newegg, bestbuy and amazon for top sellers, along with pcreviews and notebookcheck dot net (which does incredible detailed reviews showing how much heat and noise a laptop generates). I settled on this notebook and am very happy with what I got. The 2018 version is definitely worth the extra $50 over the 2017 version because the bezel (plastic border around the screen) is much smaller resulting in a laptop that is 10% smaller than the 2017 version while maintaining a 13"" screen! The faint high pitched noise put out by the motherboard is only detectable in a silent room when you place your head within 12"" of the keyboard. The battery life is stellar. Under load, the system hardly generates any heat and under light use (browsing/Word), I never hear the fan kick in. This 8th generation i5 is much more powerful than older i7 CPU's. It's incredibly thin. I was worried about the laptop looking 'gold' but it doesn't - it looks very silver with a faint hue. Very fast start-ups - I press the power button from hibernation and by the time I moved my finger to the fingerprint, I'm up and running within 2 seconds. Fully recommend."

Novelle,Verified Purchase,"Where do I begin? This beast of a gaming laptop from MSI is simply amazing. The screen is a full 1080p, the keyboard is soft, quiet, and perfect for typing as well as RGB'd, the touchpad is probably great, but I never use it as I much prefer mice, the cooling is fantastic, the sound is great, and I can tell that MSI put a lot of thought and consideration into designing this laptop. It includes a 256-gig solid-state boot drive and a terabyte HDD, which means more space and better reliability. The GTX 1060 graphics card makes it competitive, even against my old Dell Inspiron 7559, which only had a GTX 960M; and the i7-8750H processor is as fast as it is powerful. My old Dell had an i7-6700HQ, which sounds good, but only ran at a modest 2.4 GHz. According to MSI, whom I emailed to help confirm this, the i7-8750H idles at a low 2.2 GHz, but actually accelerates when gaming, making it easier to cool when not in-game, and giving you power and speed when you need it most. The i7-6700HQ does not, and thus, I experienced a lot of crashes in higher-end titles, most likely from that processor. Considering it was from Dell and not an overpriced behemoth from their Alienware lineup, my old Inspiron was good, but my MSI is downright outstanding. I simply cannot recommend this laptop (or one similar) enough - between your processor, graphics card, and 16 gigs of RAM, you're practically unstoppable."

Very light weight and aesthetically pleasing. The keyboard is a pleasure to use and the touchpad is much better than other PCs I've recently used. The model I have has the standard 1920 x 1080 display which is fine for an ultraportable. Should you desire something comparable to a Mac Retina display, I recommend upgrading to the Lenovo hi-res HDR display. For typical business use - email, MS Office, web browsing, video conferencing, etc., the Intel 8th Gen i5 processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM configuration is fine. The X1 also has a good array of ports including USB A-type, USB-C/Thunderbolt, and HDMI. After a few days of use, battery life is impressive -- probably 10 hours with web browsing, Office, and email usage. The only knock I'd give it in terms of hardware is the lid has a lot of flex to it, but I suppose this is to be expected since it's not aluminum. The other negative is not the fault of the hardware, but rather Windows 10. Setup was tedious. After going through multiple rounds of updates taking a couple of hours, I had to do a full reset and start over because the Start Menu would not save any changes. I would delete the Windows Games and other bloatware I don't need only to have it reappear. I am not set up on a domain where a Group Policy is doing this, so I decided to reset and that solved the problem. I also had to do a BIOS update and some Lenovo-dictated driver updates. After three days of use, all has been good. Within this price range, I have recently used a Microsoft Surface Laptop and a new Dell XPS 13 and prefer this Lenovo to either of those."

THIS IS A TOUCHSCREEN CHROMEBOOK, yes I tested it and the touchscreen works every time I've tried it. The only downside I would point out is that the screen is a bit on the weak side, it has a limited viewing angle, have to be right in front of it, off to the side a bit and it'll be hard to use or view. Only other thing to mention is if you want to hook it up to a monitor or TV you'll need to get a USB-C adapter like a USB-C to HDMI adapter or cord, it doesn't come with a video out port like HDMI."

Normally I would make a build of a computer with the price that a laptop would cost to balance out how each component measured. The build I did was as expensive as the laptop and the big difference was the processor which was overclock-able. This is by far of the best if not the best ratio of a laptop against a desktop. Needless to say I've loved this laptop, the benchmarks are great and the jump from a 60hz monitor to a 144hz one is massive."

I have a custom built desktop at home but decided i wanted to somehow bring my gaming with me when I'm traveling. This laptop checked off every box for me. I wanted a laptop that would give me the best competitive edge compared to the rest, but i didn't want something that weighed 10+ LBs. I also didn't want too much of the gamer look as well. This laptop is truly stunning on the outside and in. The build quality is exceptional for how thin it is. I also appreciate the ventilation and cooling system. ROG Game Center lets your customize the fan speed and accommodate how you are using the laptop. I was playing PubG over 100 FPS, Overwatch 250+ and WoW 100+. I can't stress enough how Asus knocked this one out of the park! 6.5 LBs i believe of pure gamer fury. 144hz display with a 3ms response time is phenomenal! Most gaming laptops last year were 120hz 3ms with 1070 Max-Q GPUS (under clocked for better battery). This is a full 1070, with a 6 core i7, expandable memory and tons of storage!

The display is very color accurate and pretty, but it's mind-blowing fast. Gaming with refresh rates this high not only gives an advantage, but I've found it to be easier on the eyes for long gaming sessions. The 1070 Max-Q GPU is extremely stout for a laptop. It does run warm whenever under a lot of load (75 C), but I'm yet to see it throttle. When it does get warm though the fans go into overboost and cool it back down quickly. They are audible very slightly in balanced mode, a bit noisy in overboost, but extremely quiet in silent. The computer runs fast, quiet, and very smooth. The only upgrade I see myself purchasing is an extra 16 gb stick of ram to supplement the current one. I have only one ""complaint"" with this whole computer. I knew this going into it, but any PC with components like these and a display with G-Sync battery life is gonna be bad, but be ready to keep the charger nearby. I get close to 3 hours with the brightness at 50% and no audio. That's just being on the web and streaming netflix through a wireless headset. Gaming is closer to the 2 hour mark. Aside from this though, I don't believe there's a better gaming laptop out there under $2,000 dollars."

It is thermal throttling 100% of the time, as much as 30%. I can't even browse the internet and enjoy a stable system. Fans will randomly turn into jet engines when doing nothing to tax the CPU or GPU. During gaming CPU temps average 96C and GPU temps hover around 85C. I've never seen such an aggressive thermal throttle where framerate in a game can be 125FPS one second and then 10FPS. It is apparent that the cooling solution is inadequate and they have released multiple BIOS revisions that make the thermal throttling even more aggressive to compensate for it.

I ordered the one with the smaller hard drive as I already had plans on swapping existing SSD's into the unit that were larger and performed better. I was surprised to see a Samsung M.2 NVMe SSD in the unit that was a decent performer which I considered a bonus as I was expecting one of lesser quality. The laptop is gorgeous. The screen is beautiful and the blacks are amazing. Physically, this thing is great but slightly flimsy which was done to cut down on weight, so ""I get it"". On the lesser side of things, the drive partitioning was weird. I had a 256GB drive that had two separate partitions, a 133GB partition for C: (Windows OS) and an 88GB for D: (Data?). Odd to say the least. Also, when I booted into a live linux USB and fired up gparted to fix this, I noticed that there was a partition in between the two making it a little more challenging than simply deleting a partition and expanding the other. Now, I had to delete the ""data"" partition, move the offending ""in-betweener"" partition and then expand the Windows OS partition. Next was removing as much bloatware as possible. Windows 10 bloatware, MSI bloatware, you name it, it's on there. So essentially, it took the better part of a day to get the laptop ""where I wanted it"" which in my opinion is a little much. The BIOS. There are no options for memory speed settings or XMPP profiles. There are no temperature monitoring settings. Spartan to say the least. The laptop is advertised as supporting memory up to 2666mhz, yet when I installed 3200mhz ram, it did not ""auto-detect"" the new ram speed or 2666mhz, nor were there any settings in the bios to adjust the timings or speed. This must be addressed by MSI. There are two slots for m.2 SSD drives but the motherboard is flipped upside-down so one must remove the motherboard from the laptop in order to install/change the ram or the hard drive. The ""Killer"" wifi was horrible. I changed it out with an Intel 9260 and am much happier."

Its simple, powerful, and portable. Everything a laptop should be. The one thing I didn't like was the limited storage the factory laptop gets. I got the gtx1070 with 256g of storage and that just wasn't a lot. I do understand that they have to cut corners somewhere to keep the price down but it would be nice to have a way to upgrade. Otherwise the laptop exceeds all expectations. No throttling and the fans aren't too noisy, plus the keys on the keyboard are very smooth. I really like the feel of the hardware. I don't like the speakers on the bottom but they are very loud and do a good job. The 144hz screen is phenomenal I think that is the big selling point for this laptop. Overall 4.5/5 stars."

However in July I headed back into the office for a day to work and BAM all screwed up again?!? Got everything reset and cooking along. Go into the office in August, it starts happening again. I then realize... it is the DOCKING STATION. Seems easy. I spend an entire afternoon being transferred between departments at Dell because for some reason my docking station doesn't have an ID tag. They can't do ANYTHING without this. ""I must HAVE removed"".... umm no I didn't. Finally after about 2 hours of being hung up on and transfer some guy seems to be able to help. I am on the phone with him another hour and he has me email him pics of my Amazon invoice, pics of the docking station. No problem, they'll get it out. The next day my case is ""closed"" and I am told by email to call again and they will restart this. Then they can't get me routed to the correct place again. This has now went on for 30 days of being promised it was handled to have it closed and have different person tell me to call to start a new case. I have asked for them to start a case based on the history of emails I have, as I do not have another 1/2 a day to have them transfer me around, sit on hold, and be hung up on. On top of that I have told them, at this point I want a paper trail because I have been lied to on the phone. I work (which is why I need a docking station) and can't spend 2-3 on hold. I realize I probably got the one lemon out of 1000 but seriously I can not think of a worse customer service experience than this. The docking station is useless and it causing electrically problems with the computer, Hence one star..."

My first impression is that it was small and slippery. The buttons are noisy when clicked.

It does not hold a charge for weeks at a time like they suggest. I can get a week or ten days out of it. Despite the advertised 1,600 dpi resolution there is no way to take advantage of this under Windows 10 because there are no settings for this under Windows 10 and no additional drivers or support software comes with it. Windows 10 treats this just like an ordinary mouse. You know, it is okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy one at a premium price.

Screen brilliance truly outstanding. Once it is functioning there are few better monitors, well actually there are better monitors, and at better price points. I have (had before I returned it) it working with a 2019 Apple Mac Mini, only after a cable matching problem. HP did with this monitor what it does a lot: it punishes consumers for not buying all HP, it does it by engineering technical and compatibility issues into its monitors (this is a poster child for this sort of consumer relations). The screen quality is excellent, but the user interface is from 5 years ago, as are most of the few and mostly out of date and useless inputs. As to inputs, they arrive inactive and stay that way unless and until you call HP product support to find out how to make them active. ""C"" port, it has one, but it is inactive. In fact after using the monitor and understanding how HP is engineering old parts bin parts onto a slightly above average screen I felt like a HP victim, not a customer. That was confirmed by the lack of phone support and the below average AI screens the poorly trained telephone support has when you call for help. All in all it was my mistake..again.... for trusting HP to be anything other than HP...Hopeless and Problematical. Save your money and keep looking there are better monitors out there in this price range and you can let others struggle with HP and it's average (with this monitor below average) engineering and lack of support."

Calibrated at the factory by HP (I use the Neutral Color setting - Looks very natural), plenty of connectors, including the newer USB-C, and it'll be my monitor for many years to come. The 27"" screen is perfect for my needs, and many times I will work with 2 or even 3 windows open, which makes for an awesome working experience. Everyone seems to get hyped up about 4K screens, which cost a lot more, and I guess they have a place, in some circumstances; but 1440p is plenty for most folks' needs. Keep in mind that the higher the screen resolution, the smaller everything gets on a desktop - I have no issues with 27"" & 1440p, but I know some folks who actually liked the ""standard"" 1080p better; it was more of a size thing for fonts, icons & such than any type of screen quality."

It is much faster than my old one and with better graphics. I'm not going to say a lot of great stuff because I don't want to jinx myself‚ò∫. The only issues I have had so far is solfware related and not hardware. I am working through setting up a new system only because my last one lasted since 2011 and felt like an old pair of shoes. It just fit perfectly. Unfortunately it started have small failures like the wifi quit working and I got an external one the blue tooth quick working and I found a workaround. I figured sooner or later it was going to die so here I am. So far I am thrilled with this device and very soon it will be as comfortable as the old one.

No more HP Products for me. One HP support Rep tried to get me to buy virus protection software, I said no. He had been tuning my software, remotely and left a virus on my laptop.

Given my experiences, I would buy another brand even if it cost more. HP and Windows 10 not worth the trouble and frustration."

I haven't upgraded the Ubuntu to 18.x just because in the past this has always been a problem point, you spend days recovering from Linux upgrades. The positives are 1) 64gb RAM I never run out of memory running Java server apps, 2) well behaved under stress there's no a lot of wild fan activity, 3) backlit keyboard is nice. Negatives are 1) clunky Lenovo design same old form factor from 15 years ago and very bulky, 2) display a little washed out if you're used to say a Mac retina. I mostly use it like a desktop with external monitor and keyboard and all of this works with no issues. Haven't had to go fishing around looking for Linux tweaks which is unusual. Came in a factory Lenovo box and arrived quickly, merchant was excellent."

I bought this to replace an older, aging Asus ROG laptop and I absolutely love using it! It starts up fast, plays all my games great, and is nearly half the weight of my old gaming laptop! The fingerprint scanner works every time and is a much appreciated addition to the computer. The keyboard deck is a firm aluminum, which makes typing and using the laptop in normal use feel very premium, despite the rest of the chassis being made of plastic, though the plastic certainly does not feel cheap. The computer has a very professional look to it with a hint of that gamer charm in the red accents and keyboard.

This small business/home office server performed so well, I bought another 30 days later to convert into a workstation. I suggest adding a SSD 256GB Samsung 6 GB/sec drive for the file system/operating system files and I point out the buyers should be aware there is only a HDMI video plug and therefore should have a HDMI -> DVI cable handy if needed. The one knock I have on this Tower Server is its black inset Power Button is nearly invisible on its black case. In shaded areas, the user needs a flashlight to locate and use the Power Button. The manufacturer needs to chrome the exterior of the Power Switch to help make it obvious and discern it from the black case. The worse knock on this server is the top two hard drive cages are too close to the power supply to slide in hard drives much less hot swap them out. Is the only way to add hard drives to the top two of the four hard drive cages by first removing the entire power supply? That seems like a total lapse of design and engineering on this product. Very few servers are going to only use two hard drives in the bottom two hard drive cages."

I've had many problems with USB wireless and blue-tooth mice skipping and hesitating on windows 10 1709. I decided to give this mouse a try. I love it. It is precise and very smooth in motion. It is easy to set dpi and acceleration to get just the right feel for me. The buttons have enough tactical feel so I know I have clicked and it responds instantly. It glides very smoothly on my mouse pad and does not skip. The mouse feels great in my large hands. I made 2 extra weights from 1/2"" brass rod turned down to .4695"" x .2390 to get a little more heft to the mouse. I don't think I could ask for a better mouse. I do recommend this to anyone looking for a well mannered rodent. The native windows drivers and mouse controls work perfectly with the mouse. To remove the bottom cover for the weights you use a small screwdriver to gently pry up the cover. Don't force it . The 3 supplied weights are already in the mouse when you get it."

No big deal, one year warranty, right? Absolutely wrong. HP's website to try and make a warranty claim is a nightmare, and their customer service is even worse. This product does not have a serial number ANYWHERE on it, but both online and through the phone the customer service representatives will not help you without one. I'm told that the serial number comes ON A STICKER. A damned sticker, supposedly on the bars on top of the headset. Besides the borderline criminal irresponsibility of putting a unique product identifier required for a legally-entitled warranty on a weak sticker, I am certain my product never came with such a sticker. Their customer service people have been unbelievably useless, it's an Indian call center that throws you around from person to person repeating the same ""I'm sorry sir but without your serial number we cannot help you"". Amazon Order information is useless to them, they don't care about your invoice, only the sticker that supposedly comes on a headset. To even get the phone number to call HP support I had to enter a dummy serial number just so it would let me click the ""get phone number"" button. It honestly feels like a scam to keep people from redeeming their warranty when their product inevitably breaks, serial number on a sticker. . . No way in hell am I ever buying something from HP again. Not a headset, not a computer, not a printer, not even ink and I'm going to do my damn best to make sure no one else does either; a warranty shouldn't be this difficult when a product breaks due to a manufacturer defect. I'm in awe of the way HP is handling this."

It was described as used, which at first was a bit ""eehh"" for me, but upon further inspection it just said box has been opened. I do not know why these are priced lower than the others, but it all came with original packaging and it was the real product. Smelled new. Box was in good condition, but I didn't really care about the packaging as long as the product was in good condition. The product works great. It picks up my voice well, and this is my first higher end headset that I have gotten and I heard sounds that I never before heard in games. It was so surprising to me, that I was distracted a lot in my game just listening to these additional sounds that I didn't know were there. Not only does it sound amazing for games, where it just really gets you into the whole atmosphere, it also sounds incredible if you use it to listen to music. The headset itself can get very loud, even if your TV volume is down and your mic sensitivity is low, you will have to adjust the sound settings in various games to stop from echoing. You can just continue to change it on your TV and your primary menu, but you will be adjusting it every time you switch games, so I just recommend just setting it up in individual games so that you don't have to keep messing around. One thing that is odd, is even when you are muted, you occasionally echo other people you are grouped up with, or sometimes your mic will echo a single sound that is in the game. This is a bit odd, but it is only occasionally. This may not be the case for every person who has this, it may just be an odd fluke with mine."

I needed a larger drive to store my games on. Out of the box, I formatted the drive to exFAT indicates about 1.86tb (1908GB) of usable space. I used the crystal disk mark to test performance and the numbers were comparable or better than my crucial drive. I proceeded to clone the crucial over to the micron. Once everything was cloned over I ran another test and the write performance started to underperform. I checked the drive format and it was now formatted as NTFS which was the format my crucial had. I ran tests on the crucial 512SSD and it had no issues, the read/write speeds were fine. I decided to format the micron as NTFS with nothing on the drive and ran the tests again, the write performance underperformed again. Formatted the micron a 3rd time to exFat and ran the test once more and the write performance was much better as exFAT format. Decided to copy over the data instead of attempting to clone. Tested the micron again and the numbers excelled once more. It seems like that this SSD doesn't perform well when formatted to NTFS. For the price per GB and overall it does perform well when formatted as exFat I am overall happy with the purchase and is a good bang for the buck."

You really can't beat the price, and the quality seems top notch. Write speeds are fast compared to many other budget SSDs. However, I wanted to point out that I tried exfat per a review here. However, it caused the drive to use far more space for my games. (Size on disk was about 25% larger than actual size). I ended up just cloning my 480GB SSD I was replacing, which was NTFS. I ran several tests with both file formats, and found them to be comparable. 4k 1QD reads test between 20-25MB/s, which while not mind blowing, is more than acceptable. Sustained writes, sequential read/rights, latency, and general usage have all been great for a drive at this price point."

It overclocks at the touch of a button in Gigabyte‚Äôs software, runs great, quiet, and keeps itself at a stable temp. The only reason I docked it a star is because my previous card, the Gigabyte GTX 1060 G1 Gaming card, was supposed to be the same reference design, so presumably the EKWB waterblock should fit it, but when Gigabyte designed the V2 1070, they changed the basic design from a reference model to a custom board, so no EKWB block will fit it, like it would for the V1 1070. Now I‚Äôm stuck with a $160 waterblock I can‚Äôt use, and had to buy ANOTHER $130 block from Bykski, who is currently the only maker of blocks for the version 2 1060‚Äôs and 1070‚Äôs. If you have no plans for watercooling this card, I would give it 5 stars."

Kept getting Error reports even tho I filled everything out like suggested. But that is my only gripe. Everything else including the RGB program works perfectly....Might buy from Gigabite again......

Turns out, in terms of temps, the card maintains a comfortable temp of around 60-65 Celsius under full load. In terms of acoustics, I have not noticed any abnormal fan noice at any point during use, and the case is right next to me on the desk. I use a mid tower ATX case, with 5 fans ( 3 front intakes, 1 back exhaust, 1 top exhaust ) which might be helping it a bit to maintain temps. In terms of gaming performance it is a beast. 1080p gaming is a joke for this card, nothing I throw at it has proven too much for now. Checking out some benchmarks online, I can see that it is pretty competent for 1440p as well, most titles will play above 60fps on ultra. Overall, in my use scenario: 1080p high refresh rate/fps - it is an excellent purchase."

However lately I've noticed they've become much more expensive and have this annoying tendency to have the scroll overly sensitive. I was in the market to shop for an inexpensive, basic wireless mouse and everything I saw of logitech were bulky and beyond a reasonable price. All I needed was a mouse for my work desktop that did the basic functions, didn't need back and forth buttons, or pulling up the start menu. Here is where I found the HP Z3700 mouse. I've been using it for a day now and I love it. Its light weight, basic, and does everything I need. Its also very slim and can fit in my pocket if I need to take my laptop around the office. Best part, if it breaks or gets misplaced, its only $12, compared to my other logitech mice of $40+. Win for simplicity. Can't speak about battery life or overall reliability. However I do like the fact that it uses AA batteries. One less thing to have to worry about charging."

If you like a bulging mouse...why the heck would you buy this and then complain about it as another reviewer did? Clearly states the shape in the pictures. I also love how this mouse works on any surface so far: bedspread , jeans, couch, carpet... anything so far. The scroll wheel is very responsive and can be used to open new browser tones and scroll down pages. All for under 20 bucks.

This mouse is shaped essentially the same, with the 5 buttons and the sensitivity button in the same place. It has a few more sensitivity settings than my old mouse, which doesn't matter to me since I stick with one anyways.

Kendall,,"Got this computer about a month ago. It has been a very good purchase. I paid $799 for it off our company website that was offering a corporate promotion. This is not a gaming computer. I bought this computer for personal / business uses. I use financial software, office products, photo editing and video editing software. I have had no problem with any of these. The computer is light (<4.0 lbs). It is sharp looking. The keys on the keyboard feel a bit small. Maybe, they are smaller to fit the number pad to the right. The touchpad is very responsive although I use a wireless mouse for the most part. The WiFi connects fast. It dropped a few times when on battery power. I have had this happen before and changed the power settings so it doesn't happen anymore. The battery is reported to last 10 hours. I have only gotten about 6 hours, but I don't let the screen go dim. I like it brighter. Either way, 6 hours is significantly better than my previous laptop. I really like the touchscreen. The motion sensor and hand gesturing is a neat novelty but not very practical. I like having a solid state drive so that the computer boots up from 'sleep' instantly. That is probably my favorite feature. The screen is very attractive, although I have read reviews that it is not as good as it could have been. It does not have a DVD drive which for me is not a big deal but for some people it might be. The computer does not get warm at all. It stays very cool. There is a lot of useless bloatware that was easy to remove. I would have preferred a TB harddrive, but with the TB cloud storage from Microsoft, who needs a harddrive."

I am lucky. I was able to catch it and my screen did not split. CUSTOMER NO SERVICE will let me pay a non refundable DIAGNOSIS fee. I have owned several lap tops, They have all lasted many years and the hard drive always broke. Never he case. So for a $1000. dollar year old computer.

I haven't owned any expensive pair headphones, but these sound really great. The lower frequency response is subtle. I like it that way as I can clearly hear the vocal ranges. I know other cheap headphones that try to fool customers by reducing the highs, and mid-range, to make the bass standout. On a car speaker, I would like the bass to standout. But not on headphones. Not saying there isn't any bass on these headphones, just saying that its volume is proportionate to the highs and mid-range."
