B00HIY8S7I,4,"Overall happy, complaints too minor to affect buying decision",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HI7H3TREX3OL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HIY8S7I," May 30, 2015",chicat,Verified Purchase,"I am so far happy with it. Small design changes wish Lenovo would address in future versions. I thik I keep hitting the ctrl key in the lower left but am hitting the function key. they should switch places. Also the function key has an indicator light ... why? it never goes off. It would make more sense for the capslock key to have an indicator light. I can never tell when I'm typing passwords if I accidentally hit caps lock or not because there is no notice whether it is activated or not. And last thing is understanding some new gestures. Both when I use the touchscreen and the touchpad, sometimes when I'm swiping left right to scroll the screen over, it actually switched apps, then I can't get the window/app back that I wanted."
B00HIY8S7I,2,Wrong description,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39CHBOAQIVG82/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HIY8S7I," May 16, 2014",Frank,Verified Purchase,"This machine worked fine. However, I was surprised that the maximum resolution was 1366*768, not 1920x1080 as described in the product specification. I had to return it."
B00HIY8S7I,3,Good thing I bought 3 year protection,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XV8RR1SU3ADK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HIY8S7I," July 17, 2018",José R.,,Had to replace the disk. Good thing I bought 3 year protection!

B00HK17A8W,5,"Honestly, One of the best pair of headphones out there!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUQ3EG118I9I8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK17A8W," February 11, 2016",Jeremiah B.,Verified Purchase,"Best pair of headphones I've ever owned. I haven't owned any expensive pair headphones, but these sound really great. The lower frequency response is subtle. I like it that way as I can clearly hear the vocal ranges. I know other cheap headphones that try to fool customers by reducing the highs, and mid-range, to make the bass standout. On a car speaker, I would like the bass to standout. But not on headphones. Not saying there isn't any bass on these headphones, just saying that its volume is proportionate to the highs and mid-range."
B00HK17A8W,5,Good pair of headphones for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q3UFTYLXR9NC/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK17A8W," November 4, 2017",Jerry Cee,Verified Purchase,"Well just received mine today and test them against my numark redwave carbon must say they both sound good but these JBLs is a better sounding headphone , I needed both and don’t regret it.."
B00HK17A8W,4,Sound good.  Hurt ears if worn too long.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VE3OM7SNR11U/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK17A8W," June 18, 2016",WarriorSon,Verified Purchase,"These sound good. There's a tad too much bass, but that can be overcome with EQ on your source. The ear pads hurt after an hour or 2 of wear. With glasses it's even worse. I would love if they were large enough for ears to fit inside so the pads didn't crush my ears. They're great for short sessions though."
B00HK17A8W,2,Feel cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1697EN3YK60SY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK17A8W," July 14, 2020",Zachariah,Verified Purchase,"I'm a DJ/producer. Tried them on and instantly didn't like them. I didn't even listen to music through them, because they were just so cheap and ill fitting."
B00HK17A8W,5,It is a great Headphone set,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32HZLTIBBXUQ5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK17A8W," February 5, 2015",Michael Lin,Verified Purchase,"It is a great Headphone set, on this kind of price. I would recommend to my friends. Nice to have it could be buying another one."
B00HK17A8W,4,overrated bass but very clear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q9AD834W1ILO/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK17A8W," October 16, 2019",a happy reader,Verified Purchase,Very good sound like all JBl's the bass is overrated not as strong as the other people made it sound The wire is a regular aux wire/ 1/8 . I think the look compremises on what you get for sound for 50 dollars
