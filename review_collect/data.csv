I was also in dire need of a laptop replacement since my old one died, but alas...,Hands the best purchase I’ve made in the last year. This 8 core processor is amazing! Everything is blazing fast and the extra ram helps a ton!,I bought another one at the store and it's very nice.,It's a performance monster. Works like a charm. Only issue is when you're putting in performance mode, the fans tend to get loud and it can get pretty hot. But that's if you max out the graphics and processor.,Great everyday laptop that can also game. The track pad and display have really been standing out to me (1080p version). Battery life is great, and has differebt battery settings to help it have an extended life. 65w USB-C charging is handy, only need one charger for cellphone, laptop and buds. Definitely happy with this purchase and would recommend it to most. Please note that there is no webcam in this computer, I think that's a pro but others may think is a con.","4.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars",B08DMZYJ7G
