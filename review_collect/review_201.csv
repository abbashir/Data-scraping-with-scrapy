B077H11HSN,5,Storage Surprise,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19R7AH0I2G77M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077H11HSN," November 3, 2018",Amazon Customer,Verified Purchase,"Nice laptop at a great price. I've had it for a week so it's hard to comment on durability but I'm counting on my previous experiences with Dell to carry on. For some reason I ended up with a 1TB SSD instead of the advertised 500GB SSD, probably a total fluke but I'm happy to accept it. I mostly purchased because of the i7, 16GB RAM and SSD because they contribute to a machine's longevity the most. I wanted to try the touchscreen and tablet mode but not sure how practical they are. So far running Virtual Box and Fusion360 without a problem. Looking forward to a long life together."
B077H11HSN,5,I'm Satisfied!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E8NKPPS250B4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077H11HSN," May 7, 2020",Amazon Customer,Verified Purchase,"My old laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15 5000, and it worked well for years. I really loved it, so when it started malfunctioning I knew I had to get another later model if available. This is the most expensive laptop I ever purchased, with my previous one being around $550. If I were to compare the two, this one is noticeably more light weight. It's has a great design. Everything is smooth and thin. The sound quality is about the same honestly. The camera is much better, but do not expect quality like you would on a phone or an actual camera. The screen quality is definitely nice. I love how you can fold it and it looks like a tablet. I already ordered a case, screen protector, and keyboard cover, because I'm that type of person. lol. The touchscreen responds well and with a stylus pen this is pretty much like an oversized tablet! That's all I got from it so far. I literally just got it today after ordering it two days ago, but so far so good!"

No problems. My other laptop is a dell xps 10gen 6 core 32g ram. So,my view may be skewed. Use it for my sons middle school / high school use. Screen is a little big to be easy to handle.

No documentation of ownership or media from Microsoft is provided. I think that is pretty normal on some of these systems. My intention for this is to use it for a Linux server to test web apps. After a bit of messing with BIOS settings, Linux Mint installed easily and runs well."

A lot of titles hit the 144fps mark. The problem is whenever you tilted it forward, it would click. I thought it was a HDD failure, but it wasn't. The right fan was failing. For $2,000 dollars that is unacceptable considering the GTX 1070 and i7 8750H NEED proper cooling. I returned this item for a full refund. I'd buy another one but, as a college student, I can't risk having this thing failing me when I'm away from home. My case might be a rare one, but I can't take that risk."

Great for COD BO4. However it gets pretty loud so wea ear phones and prop the laptop up to get air flow to the machine. Ran 85 degrees Celsius during gameplay (Black ops 4). The only issue is one of the fans is clicking. Possibly a loose bearing or smacking against a wire in the case. I uploaded a video with the sound.

Just set up last night, but so far it is so much better than my HP with only 8GB RAM. The 4K display is nice, it was easy to set up, and was delivered quickly. Prior to purchasing I called the seller with a few questions and they were very helpful. Will try to update more on the laptop once I’ve used it for a while. As someone else may have mentioned, the USB port by the power source is a little awkward. So far, thumbs up for a great laptop and seller."

I been holding back switching to laptop from desktop. Finally switched after seeing the capacity of this laptop (WIN 10 PRO, 2TB SSD, 32GB MEM, i7 CPU). So far it is not making me miss the desktop with similar capacity, except I had 16GB memory on the desktop. I was constantly syncing Office and Home Office PC. Now I just take the laptop with me, so I have my office PC with me always. No problem with hardware, software and or connections so far. I did get USB C hub, so I can connect to Ethernet at the office, and 32 inch 4K monitor. As well as external KB and mouse. Resolution is 4K on laptop, perfect for my needs. I did run into a problem with Acronis True Image 2019 backup, but that is not an issue with the laptop. I am waiting on Acronis tech support to resolve that today hopefully. This is a perfect laptop, thin, also tablet with pen (which I have not yet tried out), but good to have. I have replaced 2 desktops and surface pro with this one laptop. Highly recommend it."

I've bought it for work and to be handy when giving classroom instruction. A very sleek look and the 2 in 1 feature is pretty cool. I had to buy a USB port for the ethernet cable I need but it's not a serious concern. So far this laptop outperforms any laptops I had before it and I expect to use it for the next several years.

Takes time. Had issues with graphics card compatibility with Adobe Premier Pro, but after a few hours with HP customer service all was good. Over-all I am pleased with the performance and graphics display. Slight rickety sound on the bottom panel of the laptop when grabbing it as you would a book.

The laptop is sufficiently zippy although I went ahead and maxed out the RAM and added a SSD immediately which of course increased the performance of the machine.

And unless you really want / need a number pad keyboard, don't get it. At the end of the day, this laptop does perform as advertised and is light, great battery life and does the best it can with what it has to work with. But being Windows 10, it's crippled out of the gate. A MacBook Pro with Parallels will run circles around this thing and that is a fact. But it will cost about 3 times as much so bang for the buck, this is very good computing power."

The core I7 8550U Kaby-Lake processor is the same one you'll find in most high-end laptops these days, and better that the Y processors in the new macbook air. It has a generous number of connections; full size HDMI, USB 3, Usb2.1 and USB-C (3.1 specs), along with a Micro-SD slot and a 3.5mm headphone /microphone jack. The screen is a non-touch 1080P and a backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader. All in a 2.6 lb (by my scale) aluminum package. I have read some criticism of the keyboard, but personally I find it as good as any laptop keyboard and have no complaints. But, I do not write novels or technical manuals for a living so my typing is pretty basic and your mileage may vary. The down-firing Harmon Kardon branded speakers are OK. But in my opinion, people who insist on blasting there speakers for sound either live alone or don't mind annoying people around them. I have always preferred headphones."

I spent a lot of time reviewing newegg, bestbuy and amazon for top sellers, along with pcreviews and notebookcheck dot net (which does incredible detailed reviews showing how much heat and noise a laptop generates). I settled on this notebook and am very happy with what I got. The 2018 version is definitely worth the extra $50 over the 2017 version because the bezel (plastic border around the screen) is much smaller resulting in a laptop that is 10% smaller than the 2017 version while maintaining a 13"" screen! The faint high pitched noise put out by the motherboard is only detectable in a silent room when you place your head within 12"" of the keyboard. The battery life is stellar. Under load, the system hardly generates any heat and under light use (browsing/Word), I never hear the fan kick in. This 8th generation i5 is much more powerful than older i7 CPU's. It's incredibly thin. I was worried about the laptop looking 'gold' but it doesn't - it looks very silver with a faint hue. Very fast start-ups - I press the power button from hibernation and by the time I moved my finger to the fingerprint, I'm up and running within 2 seconds. Fully recommend."

First off the build quality on it is excellent, definitely a huge step up from the stuff HP normally makes. Second it integrates great with the Omen Command Center app I already have installed on my Omen gaming laptop (yay less bloatware). The DPI settings via color code are easy to get used to. I now just know which color is where I like to be 90% of the time and if I have a setting I like for a particular game I just know what color to jump to. The adjustable palm wrest is probably my favorite feature, it really lets you dial in the mouse so it fits just perfectly for how you hold."

The Omen mouse provided a total response without any ""lag"". Fast forward to earlier this week, and I was faced with the left mouse button not responding. I at first thought the issue was my system; However, when I changed the mouse to a super cheap one, I had no issues. I am NOT slamming any products from HP with this review. I further will not return the product to Amazon as I would really like to figure out the root cause of the issue. I just would like other gaming people to understand there may be issues with the ""out of the box"" performance of this mouse. HP may have an update for this mouse which I was unable to locate and install to correct the concern. Honestly, after several HOURS thinking the minimization of a game playing issue was because of my system...and then only to find out this was do to incorrect mouse input is really sad."

Two downsides in particular that may only apply to me, and one is just a very minor nitpick. First, for me at least, one of my more natural resting positions makes it so the mouse wheel is a good finger joint too short so I have to reach up to scroll, but I am sure I will adjust to it overtime. Second thing is found out I need Windows 10 to get the Omen Command Center to program the mouse. Currently I have Windows 8, but I plan on making a new computer entirely within the next few months, which will have Windows 10, so it is just a small gripe but maybe something to consider if you aren't yet modernized as I am.

I did get USB C hub, so I can connect to Ethernet at the office, and 32 inch 4K monitor. As well as external KB and mouse. Resolution is 4K on laptop, perfect for my needs. I did run into a problem with Acronis True Image 2019 backup, but that is not an issue with the laptop. I am waiting on Acronis tech support to resolve that today hopefully.

I have purchased two of these, one directly from HP and the other from Amazon, and both demonstrated this issue. I added a tiny bit of special adhesive glue, and it did not interfere with operation.

Very light weight and aesthetically pleasing. The keyboard is a pleasure to use and the touchpad is much better than other PCs I've recently used. The model I have has the standard 1920 x 1080 display which is fine for an ultraportable. Should you desire something comparable to a Mac Retina display, I recommend upgrading to the Lenovo hi-res HDR display. For typical business use - email, MS Office, web browsing, video conferencing, etc., the Intel 8th Gen i5 processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM configuration is fine. The X1 also has a good array of ports including USB A-type, USB-C/Thunderbolt, and HDMI. After a few days of use, battery life is impressive -- probably 10 hours with web browsing, Office, and email usage. The only knock I'd give it in terms of hardware is the lid has a lot of flex to it, but I suppose this is to be expected since it's not aluminum. The other negative is not the fault of the hardware, but rather Windows 10. Setup was tedious. After going through multiple rounds of updates taking a couple of hours, I had to do a full reset and start over because the Start Menu would not save any changes. I would delete the Windows Games and other bloatware I don't need only to have it reappear. I am not set up on a domain where a Group Policy is doing this, so I decided to reset and that solved the problem. I also had to do a BIOS update and some Lenovo-dictated driver updates. After three days of use, all has been good. Within this price range, I have recently used a Microsoft Surface Laptop and a new Dell XPS 13 and prefer this Lenovo to either of those."

When plugged into the station the computer will regularly wake up from sleep on it's own. I had to enable hibernate in Windows and start using that instead of sleep as a workaround. When the computer wakes up from either hibernate or sleep there are intermittent BSODs and the docking station will often start glitching (the mouse will start lagging and the audio out of the station's headphone jack will have static). The workaround I have found for that is to unplug the laptop from the docking station before bringing it out of hibernate/sleep and then plugging it back in once the computer is active. When I bought this thing I thought I'd be able to just tap the top of the dock to kick everything on but no such luck because of these issues.

As far as packaging, it arrived well-packaged with all the expected parts and came out of the box ready to play.

Tech department was continuously surprised when I mentioned how new the laptop was. I was sold a defective device, and no party has accepted any real responsibility.

I really don't get why people like them. My work computer is a Lenovo laptop and it's horrible, and my personal computer is a Lenovo laptop and it's horrible. I'm looking into getting a new computer as mine is only a couple years old and I can't stand it anymore. I bought it for video editing and it is just about useless for that. I bought it directly from Lenovo and don't understand how they build computers that have the capacity to run Premiere Pro, as in processor speed, video card, and RAM that are supposed to be enough to handle video, yet I get maybe two seconds of playback in PP before the video freezes, and sometimes the audio freezes as well, even when set to the lowest possible resolution for playback. The processor is always maxed out, even when I'm only running a browser and one program. Ever since I got it, if you bump the computer at all while playing a video file the video freezes with digital glitches all over the video image, which is probably due to the cheap hard drive. It may not be solid state, but I've never had this problem with any other SATA drives."

The positive reviews outweighed the negative, the description of it seemed on point, everything seemed great. Then I received it. Upon unboxing it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised by the shear size and weight of it. It was definitely heavier than most other laptops I owned in the past and it had a much larger screen size than I was expecting. Obviously, neither of of these characteristics were bad in my opinion, just a little unexpected is all. However, the real problems came AFTER I had turned it on and installed all the essentials. After installing the essentials such as Windows and the numerous different drivers required, I began testing the laptop out to see JUST how effective it'd be with simple, lightweight tasks such as web browsing and video streaming. I was NOT pleased. I had installed Google Chrome, as I do with all my computers, however, simply opening the app proved to be a difficult task in itself for this laptop. It'd take anywhere between 10 to about 20 seconds JUST to open Google Chrome. Sometimes it could take longer depending on whether or not you're trying to open it soon after powering on the laptop. If you power on the device, THEN try to open Google Chrome shortly there after, it would take anywhere between 20 to around 30 SECONDS!

In fact it has been great. However, I paid $160 for this item, only to find out that there are EXACTLY the same products on the market under different branding at lower prices.

When looking, a ""Diamond"" brand pulled up and after looking at the pics, I realized that it is EXACTLY the same product only with different printing on the logo area.

It makes only one sound to wake up the computer and all the devices are automatically available. This one is about 75% faster than the plugable and my internet speed is about 40% faster than it used to be with the Plugable."

You plug them in, and they just work. However, with this one, I'm seeing a very strange behavior in that my external monitors exhibit a subtle flicker when connected to this dock. They are perfectly stable and have no issues if I connect one directly to the HDMI out on my laptop, or when I test them on an alternate computer... however, bizarrely, when I type on my usb keyboard (also connected to this dock), the image on my external monitor flickers just enough to catch my eye and be distracting. I have already downloaded the latest display link drivers, and have not seen any improvement. I'll keep looking for a solution, but if I can't find one soon, I may be forced to return this one and look for another brand."

Novelle,Verified Purchase,"Where do I begin? This beast of a gaming laptop from MSI is simply amazing. The screen is a full 1080p, the keyboard is soft, quiet, and perfect for typing as well as RGB'd, the touchpad is probably great, but I never use it as I much prefer mice, the cooling is fantastic, the sound is great, and I can tell that MSI put a lot of thought and consideration into designing this laptop. It includes a 256-gig solid-state boot drive and a terabyte HDD, which means more space and better reliability. The GTX 1060 graphics card makes it competitive, even against my old Dell Inspiron 7559, which only had a GTX 960M; and the i7-8750H processor is as fast as it is powerful. My old Dell had an i7-6700HQ, which sounds good, but only ran at a modest 2.4 GHz. According to MSI, whom I emailed to help confirm this, the i7-8750H idles at a low 2.2 GHz, but actually accelerates when gaming, making it easier to cool when not in-game, and giving you power and speed when you need it most. The i7-6700HQ does not, and thus, I experienced a lot of crashes in higher-end titles, most likely from that processor. Considering it was from Dell and not an overpriced behemoth from their Alienware lineup, my old Inspiron was good, but my MSI is downright outstanding. I simply cannot recommend this laptop (or one similar) enough - between your processor, graphics card, and 16 gigs of RAM, you're practically unstoppable."

THIS IS A TOUCHSCREEN CHROMEBOOK, yes I tested it and the touchscreen works every time I've tried it. The only downside I would point out is that the screen is a bit on the weak side, it has a limited viewing angle, have to be right in front of it, off to the side a bit and it'll be hard to use or view.

The VGA picture, on an old LCD TV, is in a 4:3 aspect ratio, so some farther adjustment is needed. The ethernet internet speed was somewhat slower than my wi-fi internet connection, which surprised me, but the whole internet connectivity thing is quite variable here anyway."

Normally I would make a build of a computer with the price that a laptop would cost to balance out how each component measured. The build I did was as expensive as the laptop and the big difference was the processor which was overclock-able. This is by far of the best if not the best ratio of a laptop against a desktop. Needless to say I've loved this laptop, the benchmarks are great and the jump from a 60hz monitor to a 144hz one is massive."

I have a custom built desktop at home but decided i wanted to somehow bring my gaming with me when I'm traveling. This laptop checked off every box for me. I wanted a laptop that would give me the best competitive edge compared to the rest, but i didn't want something that weighed 10+ LBs. I also didn't want too much of the gamer look as well. This laptop is truly stunning on the outside and in. The build quality is exceptional for how thin it is. I also appreciate the ventilation and cooling system. ROG Game Center lets your customize the fan speed and accommodate how you are using the laptop. I was playing PubG over 100 FPS, Overwatch 250+ and WoW 100+. I can't stress enough how Asus knocked this one out of the park! 6.5 LBs i believe of pure gamer fury. 144hz display with a 3ms response time is phenomenal! Most gaming laptops last year were 120hz 3ms with 1070 Max-Q GPUS (under clocked for better battery). This is a full 1070, with a 6 core i7, expandable memory and tons of storage!

The display is very color accurate and pretty, but it's mind-blowing fast. Gaming with refresh rates this high not only gives an advantage, but I've found it to be easier on the eyes for long gaming sessions. The 1070 Max-Q GPU is extremely stout for a laptop. It does run warm whenever under a lot of load (75 C), but I'm yet to see it throttle. When it does get warm though the fans go into overboost and cool it back down quickly. They are audible very slightly in balanced mode, a bit noisy in overboost, but extremely quiet in silent. The computer runs fast, quiet, and very smooth. The only upgrade I see myself purchasing is an extra 16 gb stick of ram to supplement the current one. I have only one ""complaint"" with this whole computer. I knew this going into it, but any PC with components like these and a display with G-Sync battery life is gonna be bad, but be ready to keep the charger nearby. I get close to 3 hours with the brightness at 50% and no audio. That's just being on the web and streaming netflix through a wireless headset. Gaming is closer to the 2 hour mark. Aside from this though, I don't believe there's a better gaming laptop out there under $2,000 dollars."
B07BBJKCYG,4,Has its flaws but with a little work is great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F8CDQ5TP6ZGT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BBJKCYG," May 31, 2018",Jason Simon,Verified Purchase,"Overall, the laptop is great. I ordered the one with the smaller hard drive as I already had plans on swapping existing SSD's into the unit that were larger and performed better. I was surprised to see a Samsung M.2 NVMe SSD in the unit that was a decent performer which I considered a bonus as I was expecting one of lesser quality. The laptop is gorgeous. The screen is beautiful and the blacks are amazing. Physically, this thing is great but slightly flimsy which was done to cut down on weight, so ""I get it"". On the lesser side of things, the drive partitioning was weird. I had a 256GB drive that had two separate partitions, a 133GB partition for C: (Windows OS) and an 88GB for D: (Data?). Odd to say the least. Also, when I booted into a live linux USB and fired up gparted to fix this, I noticed that there was a partition in between the two making it a little more challenging than simply deleting a partition and expanding the other. Now, I had to delete the ""data"" partition, move the offending ""in-betweener"" partition and then expand the Windows OS partition. Next was removing as much bloatware as possible. Windows 10 bloatware, MSI bloatware, you name it, it's on there. So essentially, it took the better part of a day to get the laptop ""where I wanted it"" which in my opinion is a little much. The BIOS. There are no options for memory speed settings or XMPP profiles. There are no temperature monitoring settings. Spartan to say the least. The laptop is advertised as supporting memory up to 2666mhz, yet when I installed 3200mhz ram, it did not ""auto-detect"" the new ram speed or 2666mhz, nor were there any settings in the bios to adjust the timings or speed. This must be addressed by MSI. There are two slots for m.2 SSD drives but the motherboard is flipped upside-down so one must remove the motherboard from the laptop in order to install/change the ram or the hard drive. The ""Killer"" wifi was horrible. I changed it out with an Intel 9260 and am much happier."

Its simple, powerful, and portable. Everything a laptop should be. The one thing I didn't like was the limited storage the factory laptop gets. I got the gtx1070 with 256g of storage and that just wasn't a lot. I do understand that they have to cut corners somewhere to keep the price down but it would be nice to have a way to upgrade. Otherwise the laptop exceeds all expectations. No throttling and the fans aren't too noisy, plus the keys on the keyboard are very smooth. I really like the feel of the hardware. I don't like the speakers on the bottom but they are very loud and do a good job. The 144hz screen is phenomenal I think that is the big selling point for this laptop. Overall 4.5/5 stars."

Screen brilliance truly outstanding. Once it is functioning there are few better monitors, well actually there are better monitors, and at better price points. I have (had before I returned it) it working with a 2019 Apple Mac Mini, only after a cable matching problem. HP did with this monitor what it does a lot: it punishes consumers for not buying all HP, it does it by engineering technical and compatibility issues into its monitors (this is a poster child for this sort of consumer relations). The screen quality is excellent, but the user interface is from 5 years ago, as are most of the few and mostly out of date and useless inputs. As to inputs, they arrive inactive and stay that way unless and until you call HP product support to find out how to make them active. ""C"" port, it has one, but it is inactive. In fact after using the monitor and understanding how HP is engineering old parts bin parts onto a slightly above average screen I felt like a HP victim, not a customer. That was confirmed by the lack of phone support and the below average AI screens the poorly trained telephone support has when you call for help. All in all it was my mistake..again.... for trusting HP to be anything other than HP...Hopeless and Problematical. Save your money and keep looking there are better monitors out there in this price range and you can let others struggle with HP and it's average (with this monitor below average) engineering and lack of support."

I returned it and the second one is perfect, so I'm happy with that, but it's unfortunate HP's quality control is so bad this happens to some buyers. I don't understand how a panel can be colour-calibrated at the factory, but the same process doesn't also catch panels with dead pixels."

Gratis, Sr.",Verified Purchase,"Of course, this picture just doesn't do it justice; but I had to post it. I have owned many monitors since the mid-1980s, as well as using countless monitors at work. This is, by far, the BEST monitor I have ever used, especially for what I paid for it. Calibrated at the factory by HP (I use the Neutral Color setting - Looks very natural), plenty of connectors, including the newer USB-C, and it'll be my monitor for many years to come. The 27"" screen is perfect for my needs, and many times I will work with 2 or even 3 windows open, which makes for an awesome working experience. Everyone seems to get hyped up about 4K screens, which cost a lot more, and I guess they have a place, in some circumstances; but 1440p is plenty for most folks' needs. Keep in mind that the higher the screen resolution, the smaller everything gets on a desktop - I have no issues with 27"" & 1440p, but I know some folks who actually liked the ""standard"" 1080p better; it was more of a size thing for fonts, icons & such than any type of screen quality."

Was having very strange computer problem, where my keyboard would jumble letter and my bluetooth randomly be completely missing from my computer (not turned off, but gone). My IT Dept and Dell could not figure it out. They kept resetting drivers. Suddenly it stopped having these problems (yay). However in July I headed back into the office for a day to work and BAM all screwed up again?!? Got everything reset and cooking along. Go into the office in August, it starts happening again. I then realize... it is the DOCKING STATION. Seems easy. I spend an entire afternoon being transferred between departments at Dell because for some reason my docking station doesn't have an ID tag. They can't do ANYTHING without this. ""I must HAVE removed"".... umm no I didn't. Finally after about 2 hours of being hung up on and transfer some guy seems to be able to help. I am on the phone with him another hour and he has me email him pics of my Amazon invoice, pics of the docking station. No problem, they'll get it out. The next day my case is ""closed"" and I am told by email to call again and they will restart this. Then they can't get me routed to the correct place again. This has now went on for 30 days of being promised it was handled to have it closed and have different person tell me to call to start a new case. I have asked for them to start a case based on the history of emails I have, as I do not have another 1/2 a day to have them transfer me around, sit on hold, and be hung up on. On top of that I have told them, at this point I want a paper trail because I have been lied to on the phone. I work (which is why I need a docking station) and can't spend 2-3 on hold. I realize I probably got the one lemon out of 1000 but seriously I can not think of a worse customer service experience than this. The docking station is useless and it causing electrically problems with the computer, Hence one star..."

My first impression is that it was small and slippery. The buttons are noisy when clicked. The middle button works too easily, especially when I do not want it to sending my page careening up or down. The wheel has a clumsy feel probably aggravated by the middle-button click problem. It does not hold a charge for weeks at a time like they suggest. I can get a week or ten days out of it. Despite the advertised 1,600 dpi resolution there is no way to take advantage of this under Windows 10 because there are no settings for this under Windows 10 and no additional drivers or support software comes with it. Windows 10 treats this just like an ordinary mouse. You know, it is okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy one at a premium price. They only thing it has going for it is the cordless operation and quick rechargeability but beyond this, those two letters ""HP"" are an unnecessary extra expense."

This happened months ago and now the laptop is just sitting there, but now after getting a new laptop I wish I could use this one sometimes. I was walking into a narrow doorway and the side of the laptop seemingly barely GRAZED the side of the wall and that was all it took for the power button to be almost completely dented inside the laptop. I’ve reached out to HP but they charge way too much for what should be a simple repair. Besides this, the laptop WAS incredible, and this is coming from someone engulfed in the Apple Eco System."

It came with the necessary cables. I did have to contact my IT guy to make it a separate screen from my laptop other than a duplicate but that’s because I am not tech savvy. I watched him do it when we shared screens though and it was a simple fix.
B077H4DTV1,3,Overheating,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH4F7R1BR0L0P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077H4DTV1," June 30, 2019",Indo Traveler,Verified Purchase,"I used this laptop very lightly (no more than 6 hrs/week) for about 5-6 months before I began to get a System Fan (90b) error message on startup. I worked through all the solutions suggested by HP including cleaning vents (the device was immaculate and had been exceptionally well cared for - always enclosed in a sleeve when not in use), updating the Bios, etc. I could not get a response from the seller - the device was then out of their warranty period. I continued to use it as I was out of the country, and just did as little as possible to prevent damage from overheating. Last week I spent $187 on a repair service to confirm that the device is indeed overheating (not just a bogus error message), and that the fans look fine, nothing in the vents, no dust, just that the fans don't come on so no cooling. They tested some of the other components as well - but no solution. They suspect a bad motherboard. However I've ordered new fans on the off chance 2 perfect appearing fans went bad in 5-6 months of very light use. I really loved this laptop - it worked well for me and was so light and easy to use in my travels. I did install an app to monitor the temperature and hibernate when it overheats. But since it overheats quickly and goes into hibernation as soon as I start to do much of anything, that isn't a solution. I've had to switch back to my heavy ThinkPad. Just hoping the new fans (another $$$) will solve the problem."

I can't hear myself think. The noise is embarrassing when youre sitting in a relatively quiet space like in class or the library. After 5 minutes of being on it gets very hot. I often lay in bed with my computer in my lap. This laptop has burn my skin multiple times

Everything was well except the cracking speaker and HP support helped me with the replacement. Other than that, this laptop is almost perfect! There are some suggestions though."

Power port went bad after 9 months and it was a nightmare to have it repaired by HP. Unit was clearly under warranty as confirmed by search but once the unit arrived at HP no communication from them for several weeks. When I finally reached them they insisted I had to upload sales receipt, etc even though their OWN database clearly showed it under warranty. Was without unit for almost 2 months for that repair. Now 5 months later power port is going bad again and getting a fan error message. Nice machine if you don't mind giving it up for constant repairs. Not worth the cost."
