I have only been running Google Chrome and Adobe Acrobat (No gaming or high memory use type applications). When I took the computer to work in another room the battery drained within one hour (again not running an programs but work emails and typical work apps). This computer is supposed to have a ton of RAM and Memory and cost a lot of money so it is disappointing. My last HP lasted me years and was quiet and the battery lasted longer after multiple years of use using the same programs.,2.0 out of 5 stars,B08425KD9R

But as a now 40 year techie I did get a chance to see what was inside, both motherboard, case design, components. These are F grade and you cannot re-purpose, reuse or replace. Hard drive was a thin ultra-cheap Seagate (never recommended, unethical to give this to people as a main hard drive!) Power unit was like 200-250 power range - just enough to power the ultra-low end build. DVD drive paper thin F grade. Wifi-bluetooth, USB hubs everything F Grade. Designed as cheap as possible. HP (and DELL) are both fill-in-blank today. If anything breaks (including the paper thin DVD drive), it cannot be replaced on basically either due to motherboard, psu and actual case design. Nor can it really be used with any rationality in another case. I imagine the cpu, ssd and ram are in fact in the only elements that are good and are going to be third-party, intel and samsung based parts. So why would someone spend the money when you are better off buying a better case, psu, media drive and motherboard and then your cpu/ram by a long long mile? Extremely unethical PC build designed to fill-in-the-blank computer shoppers. Shocking. What happened to these companies? Grade F- And I am serious F-. I hope this review really helps someone out and saves them imminent disaster or loss. People and companies should play fair, act honorably and nice to each other. HP no longer trusted with desktops- never again.,I am not a gamer so I do not use for online gaming. I do use this for my home office and after 3 laptops have an office space dedicated to work time. I paired this with a 34” lg ultra wide monitor. All I can say is Awesome. The ssd drive allows this to boot up more like an I pad than a pc. It’s always ready to go I can run pandora and word and excel and surf the Internet or retrieve bank statements all at the same time and this baby doesn’t slow or show me the circle of waiting. I highly highly recommend,Doesn't run hot like my 2012 HP Win 7 pc used to. Had a hard time locating the on button as it needs to protrude out more. When I tried to depress it at first nothing happened. Couldn't find the DVD player for days as everything is so concealed. Very sleek design. This is not a gaming pc as that's not what I was looking for. Bought extra powerful pc so won't have to upgrade later, hopefully. Very happy with it.,The HP Envy is exactly what I thought it should be. Very fast with calculations and applying the various programs that I installed. The inside is cramped, so if anyone wants to add memory (as I did) or to try to change the HDD to an SSD, it will be difficult.,The computer seemed ideal for one of my Building Automation Display computers. But, I had a few problems. In my application, the machine is required to run 24 hours a day on a UPS. This computer initially shut down every few days and had to be manually restarted. HP support came online and reinstalled the Windows 10 OS from scratch and this fixed that problem. In this application, I have to have two identical displays connected, running the same video. First I tried to do this by connecting one display in by the regular VGA port and the second (a touchscreen) via one of the USB ports. This words, BUT, every day or so, the ""duplicate the same screen on both VGA displays"" feature quits working for one or the other displays. I also tried just running the TWO displays from the ONE VGA port. Unfortunately, the VGA display port shuts down if you try to run two displays from the port.,This has plenty of power and memory for my Quickbooks software, plus I do lots of personal stuff on the internet, like shopping, email etc. I do not play any games so I have no idea if it's suited for that. It was not advertised as a gaming computer.,This product will not support any upgrades needed for graphics or gaming. The power supply is only 180w with proprietary wiring. Unable to add graphics card as power supply cannot support. HP technical support non existant, do not respond to questions on their website. I did find an obscure third party document saying that they can be upgraded which provided a part number for the power supply. Not available in the US, need to buy from Hong Kong. THis is not acceptable, HP need to support their customers, in my case Ex customer.,I think it was a refurbished computer because it came with a wireless mouse that doesn't work and there are no instructions as to how to put the battery in if it needs one, also the instructions refer to a wired mouse. The 8 pages of instructions that did come with it refer to page 11? the keyboard doesn't work properly and won't let me connect to the internet.","1.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,1.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,2.0 out of 5 stars,1.0 out of 5 stars",B07X5259PB

This generation does not fix it. For all the usual tasks, like watching youtube, doing office work or really light gaming, it is quite and stays around 40 C. But if you were hoping to use its i7 to its full potential, be prepared for the nuc to hit 85 degrees with irritating fan noise.,I had the NUC7i5BNH but sold it due to the constant fan noise or coil whine which was really annoying. I recently bought the NUC8i5BEK and I can state that it is very quiet compared to the previous (7th gen.) model. Intel finally listened to consumers and put a better cooling system into the NUC for the 8th gen. CPUs. Also, the Core i5-8259U is a much stronger CPU than the previous i5-7260U.,Works out of the box with Proxmox VE and Ubuntu 18.04.

Probably never happened. If you buy this NUC version, you won't be thanking yourself either. Ran this guy with 8GB RAM and an SSD. Results were, initially , palatable. I had to retire this NUC and get the next version up, which is worth the extra money. Streaming HD was choking. I thought it might be the wifi, the bandwidth, something.. turns out the CPU just gets maxed out all the time. I was running a lite version of Linux, but Chrome and Firefox browsers would bring this system to its knees. Perhaps all the kerfuffle and patching with the Intel processors really made the CPU performance of this model unacceptable in 2018 and beyond.,Purchased this (along with an Samsung 850 EVO 120GB SSD and Kingston 8GB SODIMM) to replace an aging home-built midtower HTPC in a bedroom, with the intention of using it pretty much strictly for Kodi, Amazon Instant Video, and a Steam streaming box. Because of this I opted for a Linux install as Windows would be overkill. I prefer Windows but am familiar enough with Linux that it was little trouble.,I equipped mine with 4GB of Ram and a 120GB ssd. OS is Win 10 Home.,This NUC is a well-priced, low-powered machine perfect for office drones or media centers. Its GPU includes hardware acceleration for not just H.264 (AVC) but also H.265 (HEVC). Total system power consumption is very low, but it includes a 65-watt switch-mode brick which is nice.

My son is a gamer so he wanted to play fortnite/ rainbow six siege. both wouldn't launch saying the graphics card did not reach the requirement or it needed to be upgraded. We went to the intel driver site and that was an even bigger pain to install. Over all, very very bad product, all of the other good reviews are fake. Trust me on this, do not buy the product.,i order the 32g ram / 512g ssd combo,The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is I do not like false ""bait & switch"" offerings since the internal SSD was not what was advertised as a 2TB Samsung 970 NVMe. I installed a 2nd 2TB Samsung 970 NVMe and when I opened the NUC8I7HVK up, what I found in the other slot was a 2TB Intel 660p which I've pictured. Although the Intel is slower than the Samsung in benchmark transfer speed & therefore costs less, it probably will not be noticeable. Its just the fact that some of the lower star reviews also mentioned that they didn't get the stated brand of components makes this seller on my ""buyer beware"" list. I even posted a question to the seller if they could install a 2nd 2TB Samsung Evo NVMe but they couldn't as it had already been shipped. I'm glad they didn't as I probably would have gotten two Intel 660p or maybe even less. Other than that, the rest of the components, OS and processor were correct, it does run fast as expected. I use for multitasking (no gaming) and its hooked up to the new LG Ultrawide 49WL95C-W monitor. The small form factor was perfect must since the monitor takes up most of the desk.,This thing is so lame. I don't know why it is but it is! I purchased 3 of these from the same people and that in and of itself was a mistake.The sound almost never works. There is ALWAYS work to do if I want sound. Video playing is ridiculous. I get more error messages while running video (mostly basic mp4). I have and alwas have had much difficulty with mp4s, both locally as well as streaming like youtube. Intel dropped the ball on this mini PC because I have so many problems and I have the troubles on both of thes HVK models. The HNK one seems to be working fine for my wife because she hasn't complained. Both HVK models are using large tv screens as their one and only monitor. Both TVs are newer 4k models. I thought it might be that but I ran a regular monitor and no change besides, I would think Intel has long solved TV's, HDR etc.. My arrangement is common nowadays. The seller could not have cared any less about my problems and never helped me one iotta and never followed up with me...NEVER!! I would NOT buy a NUC again and will not give this merchant my return business no matter what and that is what I recommnend for other buyers... unless you are really good and don't mind a bit of trouble and need no assistance (support) from the seller. If you can make it past those glaring shortcomings then break out the cc and go for it!,Received my NUC and works great, but! one issue that will not go away no matter what I try and that is the driver for the tps65988 USB power port will not update, I have used Intels update site but the driver never corrects the problem. I've search the web for answers but no one seems to have corrective actions on this issue. So I have to give this a low rating on the system not the seller.,It's awesome! I don't use this for gaming, so this might not be the review for you. I use this for work as a laptop alternative as it's size is very portable. The power supply is nearly as big as the PC and is difficult to find a spare. Intel is giving me the run around. Apparently it's not a very common request as a spare part. Otherwise it is incredibly fast for every task I use it for and the connectivity is awesome.,UPDATE: DON't BUY THIS!

I'm glad they didn't as I probably would have gotten two Intel 660p or maybe even less. Other than that, the rest of the components, OS and processor were correct, it does run fast as expected. I use for multitasking (no gaming) and its hooked up to the new LG Ultrawide 49WL95C-W monitor. The small form factor was perfect must since the monitor takes up most of the desk.,This thing is so lame. I don't know why it is but it is! I purchased 3 of these from the same people and that in and of itself was a mistake.The sound almost never works. There is ALWAYS work to do if I want sound. Video playing is ridiculous. I get more error messages while running video (mostly basic mp4). I have and alwas have had much difficulty with mp4s, both locally as well as streaming like youtube. Intel dropped the ball on this mini PC because I have so many problems and I have the troubles on both of thes HVK models. The HNK one seems to be working fine for my wife because she hasn't complained. Both HVK models are using large tv screens as their one and only monitor. Both TVs are newer 4k models. I thought it might be that but I ran a regular monitor and no change besides, I would think Intel has long solved TV's, HDR etc.. My arrangement is common nowadays. The seller could not have cared any less about my problems and never helped me one iotta and never followed up with me...NEVER!! I would NOT buy a NUC again and will not give this merchant my return business no matter what and that is what I recommnend for other buyers... unless you are really good and don't mind a bit of trouble and need no assistance (support) from the seller. If you can make it past those glaring shortcomings then break out the cc and go for it!,Received my NUC and works great, but! one issue that will not go away no matter what I try and that is the driver for the tps65988 USB power port will not update, I have used Intels update site but the driver never corrects the problem. I've search the web for answers but no one seems to have corrective actions on this issue. So I have to give this a low rating on the system not the seller.,It's awesome! I don't use this for gaming, so this might not be the review for you. I use this for work as a laptop alternative as it's size is very portable. The power supply is nearly as big as the PC and is difficult to find a spare. Intel is giving me the run around. Apparently it's not a very common request as a spare part. Otherwise it is incredibly fast for every task I use it for and the connectivity is awesome.,UPDATE: DON't BUY THIS!

My son is a gamer so he wanted to play fortnite/ rainbow six siege. both wouldn't launch saying the graphics card did not reach the requirement or it needed to be upgraded.

I spent two months troubleshooting every possible piece of hardware/software and finally just gave up and got the Hades Canyon NUC. Immediately I had a better experience with the NUC.,,Awesome little machine packed with incredible power. It is running VR alright but you can feel it is maxing out its capacity.

Excellent value for the price. 16mb RAM and 256gb hard drive.,Would of given 5 stars BUT battery life is horrible. Have to purchase all programs separately. No backlight keyboard, which I thought it had? Still learning to use and purchased to work on the go. It is a great laptop but battery runs low after 4 hrs or so.,The laptop is surprisingly light for a 15 inch laptop and has great specifications. I love the track point and the keyboard is solid. The display is also great. The speakers are decent, but not it’s strongest point. Overall, this laptop does all of the important things right and comes in at a good price.,I was concerned about the AMD processor as I had never owned one before.

The delivery was fast as promised. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that went right. The laptop Blue Screened upon first use and continued to Blue Screen. I tried to reach the seller, they responded once and asked for the error code on the Blue Screen. I responded the Blue Screen flashes so fast I cannot read the error code. I asked for additional help and to date have not received a response. Really lousy they cannot be bothered to respond to a $1,400 plus purchase!,This computer is SUPER FAST! After completing the setup, it boots up in seconds. The processor speed runs as fast as a high end desktop PC. I just ran a WiFi Speed Test. The results: Download Speed 230 Mbps, Upload Speed 28.2 Mbps (with the laptop being about 30 feet away from the Router on the other side of the house) so the WiFi adapter runs very high speed WiFi. The M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD (Solid State Drive) is the FASTEST and most RELIABLE hard drive you can buy in a laptop! I like the sleek, slim, silver design of the HP chassis. The laptop carries the original HP manufacturer's warranty. Shipping was FAST. Overall, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this excellent computer!,I thought tge computer was amazing at first. But I quickly found out that the computer crashes and restarts after about watching 3 minutes into a video....... im extremelyrics angry about this.,Awesome laptop. Light weight, slick form factor and fast. Perfect for coding anywhere. Plus the speakers are great too.","1.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,2.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars",B07YD85SHL

It randomly reboots. It's possible that I'm overloading the processor because even though it's an Intel core i7, it's only runs at 1.6Ghz. I opened a ticket with Lenovo who advised me to do a factory reset; which upon doing so, the problem remains. Sadly, my old 4 year old acer laptop performed much better than this one. Don't waste your money on this trash.,Bought this laptop to replace my desktop and am so happy I did. Was a very easy set up and the touch screen is a great feature. I like the ability to bend the laptop in order to watch movies or use it as a tablet! The graphics are great and the sound is perfect. Overall I'm pleased with my purchase.,The ability to change his isn't is really great and welcomed. Even if we leave our charger at home, a cell charger can help (albeit slowly). The only negative I can determine so far it's there is a numerical keypad on there right off the keyboard. I would have preferred to have a larger keyboard instead.,The computer looks and likes as it is described but it did not come with a charger and I was not aware of that. I always bought computers from best buy and they always gave us charges and few accessaries such as free microsoft office for 6 months. I guess Amazon doesn't do that.,Perfect laptop for any professional that uses heavy programs such as Visio, AutoCad, Word, etc. Fast processor, quick start. Only bad thing I have to say about this laptop is the camera isn't fully clear.,Computer arrived a few days early & worked perfectly straight out of the box. Great purchase!,Great machine and performs well beyond my expectations. Not a single issue after a couple weeks of use and I love the upgrades they incorporated into the updated model.
